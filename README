The software is copyrighted by Ceetron and Statoil and licensed under GPL 3+. See COPYING for details.

DEPENDENCIES
ResInsight uses the Ensambles/ert library to access eclipse result files, and the two projects collaborates closely. The source code of the approved ert library version is embedded in the ResInsight source code tree, making downloading and building simple.
ResInsight also features an interface to Octave, making it possible to retrieve data from ResInsight, process them using Octave, and write them back into ResInsight for viewing. If you want to build ResInsight with this feature, you need to install Octave.

Set the build variables and click "Configure" again.
Click "Generate", and a project file will be created in the build directory <ResInsight-build-folder>

DEPENDENCIES FOR DEBIAN BASED DISTRIBUTIONS
