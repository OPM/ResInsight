/*
* YCbCr is defined per CCIR 601-1, except that Cb and Cr are
* normalized to the range 0..MAXJSAMPLE rather than -0.5 .. 0.5.
* The conversion equations to be implemented are therefore
*	R = Y                + 1.40200 * Cr
*	G = Y - 0.34414 * Cb - 0.71414 * Cr
*	B = Y + 1.77200 * Cb
* where Cb and Cr represent the incoming values less CENTERJSAMPLE.
* (These numbers are derived from TIFF 6.0 section 21, dated 3-June-92.)
*
* To avoid floating-point arithmetic, we represent the fractional constants
* as integers scaled up by 2^16 (about 4 digits precision); we have to divide
* the products by 2^16, with appropriate rounding, to get the correct answer.
* Notice that Y, being an integral input, does not contribute any fraction
* so it need not participate in the rounding.
*
* For even more speed, we avoid doing any multiplications in the inner loop
* by precalculating the constants times Cb and Cr for all possible values.
* For 8-bit JSAMPLEs this is very reasonable (only 256 entries per table);
* for 12-bit samples it is still acceptable.  It's not very reasonable for
* 16-bit samples, but if you want lossless storage you shouldn't be changing
* colorspace anyway.
* The Cr=>R and Cb=>B values can be rounded to integers in advance; the
* values for the G calculation are left scaled up, since we must add them
* together before rounding.

/**************** RGB -> YCbCr conversion: most common case **************/

/*
* YCbCr is defined per CCIR 601-1, except that Cb and Cr are
* normalized to the range 0..MAXJSAMPLE rather than -0.5 .. 0.5.
* The conversion equations to be implemented are therefore
*	Y  =  0.29900 * R + 0.58700 * G + 0.11400 * B
*	Cb = -0.16874 * R - 0.33126 * G + 0.50000 * B  + CENTERJSAMPLE
*	Cr =  0.50000 * R - 0.41869 * G - 0.08131 * B  + CENTERJSAMPLE
* (These numbers are derived from TIFF 6.0 section 21, dated 3-June-92.)
* Note: older versions of the IJG code used a zero offset of MAXJSAMPLE/2,
* rather than CENTERJSAMPLE, for Cb and Cr.  This gave equal positive and
* negative swings for Cb/Cr, but meant that grayscale values (Cb=Cr=0)
* were not represented exactly.  Now we sacrifice exact representation of
* maximum red and maximum blue in order to get exact grayscales.
*
* To avoid floating-point arithmetic, we represent the fractional constants
* as integers scaled up by 2^16 (about 4 digits precision); we have to divide
* the products by 2^16, with appropriate rounding, to get the correct answer.
*
* For even more speed, we avoid doing any multiplications in the inner loop
* by precalculating the constants times R,G,B for all possible values.
* For 8-bit JSAMPLEs this is very reasonable (only 256 entries per table);
* for 12-bit samples it is still acceptable.  It's not very reasonable for
* 16-bit samples, but if you want lossless storage you shouldn't be changing
* colorspace anyway.
* The CENTERJSAMPLE offsets and the rounding fudge-factor of 0.5 are included
* in the tables to save adding them separately in the inner loop.

/*
* Generate the best Huffman code table for the given counts, fill htbl.

*
* The JPEG standard requires that no symbol be assigned a codeword of all
* one bits (so that padding bits added at the end of a compressed segment
* can't look like a valid code).  Because of the canonical ordering of
* codewords, this just means that there must be an unused slot in the
* longest codeword length category.  Section K.2 of the JPEG spec suggests
* reserving such a slot by pretending that symbol 256 is a valid symbol
* with count 1.  In theory that's not optimal; giving it count zero but
* including it in the symbol set anyway should give a better Huffman code.
* But the theoretically better code actually seems to come out worse in
* practice, because it produces more all-ones bytes (which incur stuffed
* zero bytes in the final file).  In any case the difference is tiny.
*
* The JPEG standard requires Huffman codes to be no more than 16 bits long.
* If some symbols have a very small but nonzero probability, the Huffman tree
* must be adjusted to meet the code length restriction.  We currently use
* the adjustment method suggested in JPEG section K.2.  This method is *not*
* optimal; it may not choose the best possible limited-length code.  But
* typically only very-low-frequency symbols will be given less-than-optimal
* lengths, so the code is almost optimal.  Experimental comparisons against
* an optimal limited-length-code algorithm indicate that the difference is
* microscopic --- usually less than a hundredth of a percent of total size.
* So the extra complexity of an optimal algorithm doesn't seem worthwhile.

* Copyright (C) 1991-1996, Thomas G. Lane.
* This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.
* For conditions of distribution and use, see the accompanying README file.
*
* This file contains downsampling routines.
*
* Downsampling input data is counted in "row groups".  A row group
* is defined to be max_v_samp_factor pixel rows of each component,
* from which the downsampler produces v_samp_factor sample rows.
* A single row group is processed in each call to the downsampler module.
*
* The downsampler is responsible for edge-expansion of its output data
* to fill an integral number of DCT blocks horizontally.  The source buffer
* may be modified if it is helpful for this purpose (the source buffer is
* allocated wide enough to correspond to the desired output width).
* The caller (the prep controller) is responsible for vertical padding.
*
* The downsampler may request "context rows" by setting need_context_rows
* during startup.  In this case, the input arrays will contain at least
* one row group's worth of pixels above and below the passed-in data;
* the caller will create dummy rows at image top and bottom by replicating
* the first or last real pixel row.
*
* An excellent reference for image resampling is
*   Digital Image Warping, George Wolberg, 1990.
*   Pub. by IEEE Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, CA. ISBN 0-8186-8944-7.
*
* The downsampling algorithm used here is a simple average of the source
* pixels covered by the output pixel.  The hi-falutin sampling literature
* refers to this as a "box filter".  In general the characteristics of a box
* filter are not very good, but for the specific cases we normally use (1:1
* and 2:1 ratios) the box is equivalent to a "triangle filter" which is not
* nearly so bad.  If you intend to use other sampling ratios, you'd be well
* advised to improve this code.
*
* A simple input-smoothing capability is provided.  This is mainly intended
* for cleaning up color-dithered GIF input files (if you find it inadequate,
* we suggest using an external filtering program such as pnmconvol).  When
* enabled, each input pixel P is replaced by a weighted sum of itself and its
* eight neighbors.  P's weight is 1-8*SF and each neighbor's weight is SF,
* where SF = (smoothing_factor / 1024).
* Currently, smoothing is only supported for 2h2v sampling factors.

*
* There is no such thing as an EOF return.  If the end of the file has been
* reached, the routine has a choice of ERREXIT() or inserting fake data into
* the buffer.  In most cases, generating a warning message and inserting a
* fake EOI marker is the best course of action --- this will allow the
* decompressor to output however much of the image is there.  However,
* the resulting error message is misleading if the real problem is an empty
* input file, so we handle that case specially.
*
* In applications that need to be able to suspend compression due to input
* not being available yet, a FALSE return indicates that no more data can be
* obtained right now, but more may be forthcoming later.  In this situation,
* the decompressor will return to its caller (with an indication of the
* number of scanlines it has read, if any).  The application should resume
* decompression after it has loaded more data into the input buffer.  Note
* that there are substantial restrictions on the use of suspension --- see
* the documentation.
*
* When suspending, the decompressor will back up to a convenient restart point
* (typically the start of the current MCU). next_input_byte & bytes_in_buffer
* indicate where the restart point will be if the current call returns FALSE.
* Data beyond this point must be rescanned after resumption, so move it to
* the front of the buffer rather than discarding it.

/*
* In the current system design, the main buffer need never be a full-image
* buffer; any full-height buffers will be found inside the coefficient or
* postprocessing controllers.  Nonetheless, the main controller is not
* trivial.  Its responsibility is to provide context rows for upsampling/
* rescaling, and doing this in an efficient fashion is a bit tricky.
*
* Postprocessor input data is counted in "row groups".  A row group
* is defined to be (v_samp_factor * DCT_scaled_size / min_DCT_scaled_size)
* sample rows of each component.  (We require DCT_scaled_size values to be
* chosen such that these numbers are integers.  In practice DCT_scaled_size
* values will likely be powers of two, so we actually have the stronger
* condition that DCT_scaled_size / min_DCT_scaled_size is an integer.)
* Upsampling will typically produce max_v_samp_factor pixel rows from each
* row group (times any additional scale factor that the upsampler is
* applying).
*
* The coefficient controller will deliver data to us one iMCU row at a time;
* each iMCU row contains v_samp_factor * DCT_scaled_size sample rows, or
* exactly min_DCT_scaled_size row groups.  (This amount of data corresponds
* to one row of MCUs when the image is fully interleaved.)  Note that the
* number of sample rows varies across components, but the number of row
* groups does not.  Some garbage sample rows may be included in the last iMCU
* row at the bottom of the image.
*
* Depending on the vertical scaling algorithm used, the upsampler may need
* access to the sample row(s) above and below its current input row group.
* The upsampler is required to set need_context_rows TRUE at global selection
* time if so.  When need_context_rows is FALSE, this controller can simply
* obtain one iMCU row at a time from the coefficient controller and dole it
* out as row groups to the postprocessor.
*
* When need_context_rows is TRUE, this controller guarantees that the buffer
* passed to postprocessing contains at least one row group's worth of samples
* above and below the row group(s) being processed.  Note that the context
* rows "above" the first passed row group appear at negative row offsets in
* the passed buffer.  At the top and bottom of the image, the required
* context rows are manufactured by duplicating the first or last real sample
* row; this avoids having special cases in the upsampling inner loops.
*
* The amount of context is fixed at one row group just because that's a
* convenient number for this controller to work with.  The existing
* upsamplers really only need one sample row of context.  An upsampler
* supporting arbitrary output rescaling might wish for more than one row
* group of context when shrinking the image; tough, we don't handle that.
* (This is justified by the assumption that downsizing will be handled mostly
* by adjusting the DCT_scaled_size values, so that the actual scale factor at
* the upsample step needn't be much less than one.)
*
* To provide the desired context, we have to retain the last two row groups
* of one iMCU row while reading in the next iMCU row.  (The last row group
* can't be processed until we have another row group for its below-context,
* and so we have to save the next-to-last group too for its above-context.)
* We could do this most simply by copying data around in our buffer, but
* that'd be very slow.  We can avoid copying any data by creating a rather
* strange pointer structure.  Here's how it works.  We allocate a workspace
* consisting of M+2 row groups (where M = min_DCT_scaled_size is the number
* of row groups per iMCU row).  We create two sets of redundant pointers to
* the workspace.  Labeling the physical row groups 0 to M+1, the synthesized
* pointer lists look like this:
*                   M+1                          M-1
* master pointer --> 0         master pointer --> 0
*                    1                            1
*                   ...                          ...
*                   M-3                          M-3
*                   M-2                           M
*                   M-1                          M+1
*                    M                           M-2
*                   M+1                          M-1
*                    0                            0
* We read alternate iMCU rows using each master pointer; thus the last two
* row groups of the previous iMCU row remain un-overwritten in the workspace.
* The pointer lists are set up so that the required context rows appear to
* be adjacent to the proper places when we pass the pointer lists to the
* upsampler.
*
* The above pictures describe the normal state of the pointer lists.
* At top and bottom of the image, we diddle the pointer lists to duplicate
* the first or last sample row as necessary (this is cheaper than copying
* sample rows around).
*
* This scheme breaks down if M < 2, ie, min_DCT_scaled_size is 1.  In that
* situation each iMCU row provides only one row group so the buffering logic
* must be different (eg, we must read two iMCU rows before we can emit the
* first row group).  For now, we simply do not support providing context
* rows when min_DCT_scaled_size is 1.  That combination seems unlikely to
* be worth providing --- if someone wants a 1/8th-size preview, they probably
* want it quick and dirty, so a context-free upsampler is sufficient.

* BEWARE OF KLUDGE:  This subroutine is a hack for decoding illegal JPEG-in-
*                    TIFF encapsulations produced by Microsoft's Wang Imaging
* for Windows application with the public-domain TIFF Library.  Based upon an
* examination of selected output files, this program apparently divides a JPEG
* bit-stream into consecutive horizontal TIFF "strips", such that the JPEG
* encoder's/decoder's DC coefficients for each image component are reset before
* each "strip".  Moreover, a "strip" is not necessarily encoded in a multiple
* of 8 bits, so one must sometimes discard 1-7 bits at the end of each "strip"
* for alignment to the next input-Byte storage boundary.  IJG JPEG Library
* decoder state is not normally exposed to client applications, so this sub-
* routine provides the TIFF Library with a "hook" to make these corrections.
* It should be called after "jpeg_start_decompress()" and before
* "jpeg_finish_decompress()", just before decoding each "strip" using
* "jpeg_read_raw_data()" or "jpeg_read_scanlines()".
*
* This kludge is not sanctioned or supported by the Independent JPEG Group, and
* future changes to the IJG JPEG Library might invalidate it.  Do not send bug
* reports about this code to IJG developers.  Instead, contact the author for
* advice: Scott B. Marovich <marovich@hpl.hp.com>, Hewlett-Packard Labs, 6/01.

/*
* Routines to process JPEG markers.
*
* Entry condition: JPEG marker itself has been read and its code saved
*   in cinfo->unread_marker; input restart point is just after the marker.
*
* Exit: if return TRUE, have read and processed any parameters, and have
*   updated the restart point to point after the parameters.
*   If return FALSE, was forced to suspend before reaching end of
*   marker parameters; restart point has not been moved.  Same routine
*   will be called again after application supplies more input data.
*
* This approach to suspension assumes that all of a marker's parameters
* can fit into a single input bufferload.  This should hold for "normal"
* markers.  Some COM/APPn markers might have large parameter segments
* that might not fit.  If we are simply dropping such a marker, we use
* skip_input_data to get past it, and thereby put the problem on the
* source manager's shoulders.  If we are saving the marker's contents
* into memory, we use a slightly different convention: when forced to
* suspend, the marker processor updates the restart point to the end of
* what it's consumed (ie, the end of the buffer) before returning FALSE.
* On resumption, cinfo->unread_marker still contains the marker code,
* but the data source will point to the next chunk of marker data.
* The marker processor must retain internal state to deal with this.
*
* Note that we don't bother to avoid duplicate trace messages if a
* suspension occurs within marker parameters.  Other side effects
* require more care.

*      dependent on buffer size and chance buffer-boundary positions.)
*   3. Leave the marker unread (by failing to zero cinfo->unread_marker).
*      This will cause the entropy decoder to process an empty data segment,
*      inserting dummy zeroes, and then we will reprocess the marker.
*
* #2 is appropriate if we think the desired marker lies ahead, while #3 is
* appropriate if the found marker is a future restart marker (indicating
* that we have missed the desired restart marker, probably because it got
* corrupted).
* We apply #2 or #3 if the found marker is a restart marker no more than
* two counts behind or ahead of the expected one.  We also apply #2 if the
* found marker is not a legal JPEG marker code (it's certainly bogus data).
* If the found marker is a restart marker more than 2 counts away, we do #1
* (too much risk that the marker is erroneous; with luck we will be able to
* resync at some future point).
* For any valid non-restart JPEG marker, we apply #3.  This keeps us from
* overrunning the end of a scan.  An implementation limited to single-scan
* files might find it better to apply #2 for markers other than EOI, since
* any other marker would have to be bogus data in that case.

/*
* Several decompression processes need to range-limit values to the range
* 0..MAXJSAMPLE; the input value may fall somewhat outside this range
* due to noise introduced by quantization, roundoff error, etc.  These
* processes are inner loops and need to be as fast as possible.  On most
* machines, particularly CPUs with pipelines or instruction prefetch,
* a (subscript-check-less) C table lookup
*		x = sample_range_limit[x];
* is faster than explicit tests
*		if (x < 0)  x = 0;
*		else if (x > MAXJSAMPLE)  x = MAXJSAMPLE;
* These processes all use a common table prepared by the routine below.
*
* For most steps we can mathematically guarantee that the initial value
* of x is within MAXJSAMPLE+1 of the legal range, so a table running from
* -(MAXJSAMPLE+1) to 2*MAXJSAMPLE+1 is sufficient.  But for the initial
* limiting step (just after the IDCT), a wildly out-of-range value is 
* possible if the input data is corrupt.  To avoid any chance of indexing
* off the end of memory and getting a bad-pointer trap, we perform the
* post-IDCT limiting thus:
*		x = range_limit[x & MASK];
* where MASK is 2 bits wider than legal sample data, ie 10 bits for 8-bit
* samples.  Under normal circumstances this is more than enough range and
* a correct output will be generated; with bogus input data the mask will
* cause wraparound, and we will safely generate a bogus-but-in-range output.
* For the post-IDCT step, we want to convert the data from signed to unsigned
* representation by adding CENTERJSAMPLE at the same time that we limit it.
* So the post-IDCT limiting table ends up looking like this:
*   CENTERJSAMPLE,CENTERJSAMPLE+1,...,MAXJSAMPLE,
*   MAXJSAMPLE (repeat 2*(MAXJSAMPLE+1)-CENTERJSAMPLE times),
*   0          (repeat 2*(MAXJSAMPLE+1)-CENTERJSAMPLE times),
*   0,1,...,CENTERJSAMPLE-1
* Negative inputs select values from the upper half of the table after
* masking.
*
* We can save some space by overlapping the start of the post-IDCT table
* with the simpler range limiting table.  The post-IDCT table begins at
* sample_range_limit + CENTERJSAMPLE.
*
* Note that the table is allocated in near data space on PCs; it's small
* enough and used often enough to justify this.

* Copyright (C) 1994-1996, Thomas G. Lane.
* This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.

*
* This file contains code for merged upsampling/color conversion.
*
* This file combines functions from jdsample.c and jdcolor.c;
* read those files first to understand what's going on.
*
* When the chroma components are to be upsampled by simple replication
* (ie, box filtering), we can save some work in color conversion by
* calculating all the output pixels corresponding to a pair of chroma
* samples at one time.  In the conversion equations
*	R = Y           + K1 * Cr
*	G = Y + K2 * Cb + K3 * Cr
*	B = Y + K4 * Cb
* only the Y term varies among the group of pixels corresponding to a pair
* of chroma samples, so the rest of the terms can be calculated just once.
* At typical sampling ratios, this eliminates half or three-quarters of the
* multiplications needed for color conversion.
*
* This file currently provides implementations for the following cases:
*	YCbCr => RGB color conversion only.
*	Sampling ratios of 2h1v or 2h2v.
*	No scaling needed at upsample time.
*	Corner-aligned (non-CCIR601) sampling alignment.
* Other special cases could be added, but in most applications these are
* the only common cases.  (For uncommon cases we fall back on the more
* general code in jdsample.c and jdcolor.c.)

* The entire image is read into a set of virtual coefficient-block arrays,
* one per component.  The return value is a pointer to the array of
* virtual-array descriptors.  These can be manipulated directly via the
* JPEG memory manager, or handed off to jpeg_write_coefficients().
* To release the memory occupied by the virtual arrays, call
* jpeg_finish_decompress() when done with the data.
*
* An alternative usage is to simply obtain access to the coefficient arrays
* during a buffered-image-mode decompression operation.  This is allowed
* after any jpeg_finish_output() call.  The arrays can be accessed until
* jpeg_finish_decompress() is called.  (Note that any call to the library
* may reposition the arrays, so don't rely on access_virt_barray() results
* to stay valid across library calls.)
*
* Returns NULL if suspended.  This case need be checked only if
* a suspending data source is used.

* The poop on this scaling stuff is as follows:
*
* Each 1-D DCT step produces outputs which are a factor of sqrt(N)
* larger than the true DCT outputs.  The final outputs are therefore
* a factor of N larger than desired; since N=8 this can be cured by
* a simple right shift at the end of the algorithm.  The advantage of
* this arrangement is that we save two multiplications per 1-D DCT,
* because the y0 and y4 outputs need not be divided by sqrt(N).
* In the IJG code, this factor of 8 is removed by the quantization step
* (in jcdctmgr.c), NOT in this module.
*
* We have to do addition and subtraction of the integer inputs, which
* is no problem, and multiplication by fractional constants, which is
* a problem to do in integer arithmetic.  We multiply all the constants
* by CONST_SCALE and convert them to integer constants (thus retaining
* CONST_BITS bits of precision in the constants).  After doing a
* multiplication we have to divide the product by CONST_SCALE, with proper
* rounding, to produce the correct output.  This division can be done
* cheaply as a right shift of CONST_BITS bits.  We postpone shifting
* as long as possible so that partial sums can be added together with
* full fractional precision.
*
* The outputs of the first pass are scaled up by PASS1_BITS bits so that
* they are represented to better-than-integral precision.  These outputs
* require BITS_IN_JSAMPLE + PASS1_BITS + 3 bits; this fits in a 16-bit word
* with the recommended scaling.  (For 12-bit sample data, the intermediate
* array is INT32 anyway.)
*
* To avoid overflow of the 32-bit intermediate results in pass 2, we must

* shows that the values given below are the most effective.

* Copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
* This file is part of the Independent JPEG Group's software.

*
* This file contains a slow-but-accurate integer implementation of the
* inverse DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).  In the IJG code, this routine
* must also perform dequantization of the input coefficients.
*
* A 2-D IDCT can be done by 1-D IDCT on each column followed by 1-D IDCT
* on each row (or vice versa, but it's more convenient to emit a row at
* a time).  Direct algorithms are also available, but they are much more
* complex and seem not to be any faster when reduced to code.
*
* This implementation is based on an algorithm described in
*   C. Loeffler, A. Ligtenberg and G. Moschytz, "Practical Fast 1-D DCT
*   Algorithms with 11 Multiplications", Proc. Int'l. Conf. on Acoustics,
*   Speech, and Signal Processing 1989 (ICASSP '89), pp. 988-991.
* The primary algorithm described there uses 11 multiplies and 29 adds.
* We use their alternate method with 12 multiplies and 32 adds.
* The advantage of this method is that no data path contains more than one
* multiplication; this allows a very simple and accurate implementation in
* scaled fixed-point arithmetic, with a minimal number of shifts.

* The poop on this scaling stuff is as follows:
*
* Each 1-D IDCT step produces outputs which are a factor of sqrt(N)
* larger than the true IDCT outputs.  The final outputs are therefore
* a factor of N larger than desired; since N=8 this can be cured by
* a simple right shift at the end of the algorithm.  The advantage of
* this arrangement is that we save two multiplications per 1-D IDCT,
* because the y0 and y4 inputs need not be divided by sqrt(N).
*
* We have to do addition and subtraction of the integer inputs, which
* is no problem, and multiplication by fractional constants, which is
* a problem to do in integer arithmetic.  We multiply all the constants
* by CONST_SCALE and convert them to integer constants (thus retaining
* CONST_BITS bits of precision in the constants).  After doing a
* multiplication we have to divide the product by CONST_SCALE, with proper
* rounding, to produce the correct output.  This division can be done
* cheaply as a right shift of CONST_BITS bits.  We postpone shifting
* as long as possible so that partial sums can be added together with
* full fractional precision.
*
* The outputs of the first pass are scaled up by PASS1_BITS bits so that
* they are represented to better-than-integral precision.  These outputs
* require BITS_IN_JSAMPLE + PASS1_BITS + 3 bits; this fits in a 16-bit word
* with the recommended scaling.  (To scale up 12-bit sample data further, an
* intermediate INT32 array would be needed.)
*
* To avoid overflow of the 32-bit intermediate results in pass 2, we must
* have BITS_IN_JSAMPLE + CONST_BITS + PASS1_BITS <= 26.  Error analysis
* shows that the values given below are the most effective.

*
* The implementation is based on the Loeffler, Ligtenberg and Moschytz (LL&M)

* with an 8-to-4 step that produces the four averages of two adjacent outputs
* (or an 8-to-2 step producing two averages of four outputs, for 2x2 output).
* These steps were derived by computing the corresponding values at the end
* of the normal LL&M code, then simplifying as much as possible.
*
* 1x1 is trivial: just take the DC coefficient divided by 8.

* The major functions provided here are:
*   * pool-based allocation and freeing of memory;
*   * policy decisions about how to divide available memory among the
*     virtual arrays;
*   * control logic for swapping virtual arrays between main memory and
*     backing storage.
* The separate system-dependent file provides the actual backing-storage
* access code, and it contains the policy decision about how much total
* main memory to use.
* This file is system-dependent in the sense that some of its functions
* are unnecessary in some systems.  For example, if there is enough virtual
* memory so that backing storage will never be used, much of the virtual
* array control logic could be removed.  (Of course, if you have that much
* memory then you shouldn't care about a little bit of unused code...)

* Many machines require storage alignment: longs must start on 4-byte
* boundaries, doubles on 8-byte boundaries, etc.  On such machines, malloc()

* requirement, and we had better do so too.
* There isn't any really portable way to determine the worst-case alignment
* requirement.  This module assumes that the alignment requirement is
* multiples of sizeof(ALIGN_TYPE).
* By default, we define ALIGN_TYPE as double.  This is necessary on some
* workstations (where doubles really do need 8-byte alignment) and will work
* fine on nearly everything.  If your machine has lesser alignment needs,
* you can save a few bytes by making ALIGN_TYPE smaller.
* The only place I know of where this will NOT work is certain Macintosh
* 680x0 compilers that define double as a 10-byte IEEE extended float.
* Doing 10-byte alignment is counterproductive because longwords won't be
* aligned well.  Put "#define ALIGN_TYPE long" in jconfig.h if you have

/*
* About virtual array management:
*
* The above "normal" array routines are only used to allocate strip buffers
* (as wide as the image, but just a few rows high).  Full-image-sized buffers
* are handled as "virtual" arrays.  The array is still accessed a strip at a
* time, but the memory manager must save the whole array for repeated
* accesses.  The intended implementation is that there is a strip buffer in
* memory (as high as is possible given the desired memory limit), plus a
* backing file that holds the rest of the array.
*
* The request_virt_array routines are told the total size of the image and
* the maximum number of rows that will be accessed at once.  The in-memory
* buffer must be at least as large as the maxaccess value.
*
* The request routines create control blocks but not the in-memory buffers.
* That is postponed until realize_virt_arrays is called.  At that time the
* total amount of space needed is known (approximately, anyway), so free
* memory can be divided up fairly.
*
* The access_virt_array routines are responsible for making a specific strip
* area accessible (after reading or writing the backing file, if necessary).
* Note that the access routines are told whether the caller intends to modify
* the accessed strip; during a read-only pass this saves having to rewrite
* data to disk.  The access routines are also responsible for pre-zeroing
* any newly accessed rows, if pre-zeroing was requested.
*
* In current usage, the access requests are usually for nonoverlapping
* strips; that is, successive access start_row numbers differ by exactly
* num_rows = maxaccess.  This means we can get good performance with simple
* buffer dump/reload logic, by making the in-memory buffer be a multiple
* of the access height; then there will never be accesses across bufferload
* boundaries.  The code will still work with overlapping access requests,
* but it doesn't handle bufferload overlaps very efficiently.

/*
* The main purpose of 1-pass quantization is to provide a fast, if not very
* high quality, colormapped output capability.  A 2-pass quantizer usually
* gives better visual quality; however, for quantized grayscale output this
* quantizer is perfectly adequate.  Dithering is highly recommended with this
* quantizer, though you can turn it off if you really want to.
*
* In 1-pass quantization the colormap must be chosen in advance of seeing the
* image.  We use a map consisting of all combinations of Ncolors[i] color
* values for the i'th component.  The Ncolors[] values are chosen so that
* their product, the total number of colors, is no more than that requested.
* (In most cases, the product will be somewhat less.)
*
* Since the colormap is orthogonal, the representative value for each color
* component can be determined without considering the other components;
* then these indexes can be combined into a colormap index by a standard
* N-dimensional-array-subscript calculation.  Most of the arithmetic involved
* can be precalculated and stored in the lookup table colorindex[].
* colorindex[i][j] maps pixel value j in component i to the nearest

/* Declarations for ordered dithering.
*
* We use a standard 16x16 ordered dither array.  The basic concept of ordered
* dithering is described in many references, for instance Dale Schumacher's
* chapter II.2 of Graphics Gems II (James Arvo, ed. Academic Press, 1991).
* In place of Schumacher's comparisons against a "threshold" value, we add a
* "dither" value to the input pixel and then round the result to the nearest
* output value.  The dither value is equivalent to (0.5 - threshold) times
* the distance between output values.  For ordered dithering, we assume that
* the output colors are equally spaced; if not, results will probably be
* worse, since the dither may be too much or too little at a given point.
*
* The normal calculation would be to form pixel value + dither, range-limit
* this to 0..MAXJSAMPLE, and then index into the colorindex table as usual.
* We can skip the separate range-limiting step by extending the colorindex
* table in both directions.

/*
* This module implements the well-known Heckbert paradigm for color
* quantization.  Most of the ideas used here can be traced back to
* Heckbert's seminal paper
*   Heckbert, Paul.  "Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display",
*   Proc. SIGGRAPH '82, Computer Graphics v.16 #3 (July 1982), pp 297-304.
*
* In the first pass over the image, we accumulate a histogram showing the
* usage count of each possible color.  To keep the histogram to a reasonable
* size, we reduce the precision of the input; typical practice is to retain
* 5 or 6 bits per color, so that 8 or 4 different input values are counted
* in the same histogram cell.
*
* Next, the color-selection step begins with a box representing the whole
* color space, and repeatedly splits the "largest" remaining box until we
* have as many boxes as desired colors.  Then the mean color in each
* remaining box becomes one of the possible output colors.
* 
* The second pass over the image maps each input pixel to the closest output
* color (optionally after applying a Floyd-Steinberg dithering correction).
* This mapping is logically trivial, but making it go fast enough requires
* considerable care.
*
* Heckbert-style quantizers vary a good deal in their policies for choosing
* the "largest" box and deciding where to cut it.  The particular policies
* used here have proved out well in experimental comparisons, but better ones
* may yet be found.
*
* In earlier versions of the IJG code, this module quantized in YCbCr color
* space, processing the raw upsampled data without a color conversion step.
* This allowed the color conversion math to be done only once per colormap
* entry, not once per pixel.  However, that optimization precluded other
* useful optimizations (such as merging color conversion with upsampling)
* and it also interfered with desired capabilities such as quantizing to an
* externally-supplied colormap.  We have therefore abandoned that approach.
* The present code works in the post-conversion color space, typically RGB.
*
* To improve the visual quality of the results, we actually work in scaled
* RGB space, giving G distances more weight than R, and R in turn more than
* B.  To do everything in integer math, we must use integer scale factors.
* The 2/3/1 scale factors used here correspond loosely to the relative
* weights of the colors in the NTSC grayscale equation.
* If you want to use this code to quantize a non-RGB color space, you'll
* probably need to change these scale factors.
*/

* and B,G,R orders.  If you define some other weird order in jmorecfg.h,
* you'll get compile errors until you extend this logic.  In that case
* you'll probably want to tweak the histogram sizes too.

/*
* First we have the histogram data structure and routines for creating it.
*
* The number of bits of precision can be adjusted by changing these symbols.
* We recommend keeping 6 bits for G and 5 each for R and B.
* If you have plenty of memory and cycles, 6 bits all around gives marginally
* better results; if you are short of memory, 5 bits all around will save
* some space but degrade the results.
* To maintain a fully accurate histogram, we'd need to allocate a "long"
* (preferably unsigned long) for each cell.  In practice this is overkill;
* we can get by with 16 bits per cell.  Few of the cell counts will overflow,
* and clamping those that do overflow to the maximum value will give close-
* enough results.  This reduces the recommended histogram size from 256Kb
* to 128Kb, which is a useful savings on PC-class machines.
* (In the second pass the histogram space is re-used for pixel mapping data;
* in that capacity, each cell must be able to store zero to the number of
* desired colors.  16 bits/cell is plenty for that too.)
* Since the JPEG code is intended to run in small memory model on 80x86
* machines, we can't just allocate the histogram in one chunk.  Instead
* of a true 3-D array, we use a row of pointers to 2-D arrays.  Each
* pointer corresponds to a C0 value (typically 2^5 = 32 pointers) and
* each 2-D array has 2^6*2^5 = 2048 or 2^6*2^6 = 4096 entries.  Note that
* on 80x86 machines, the pointer row is in near memory but the actual
* arrays are in far memory (same arrangement as we use for image arrays).

* We work left-to-right on even rows, right-to-left on odd rows.

* need only a few extra variables to hold the errors immediately around the

* even if not, they're probably cheaper to access than array elements are.)

/*
* These routines are concerned with the time-critical task of mapping input
* colors to the nearest color in the selected colormap.
*
* We re-use the histogram space as an "inverse color map", essentially a
* cache for the results of nearest-color searches.  All colors within a
* histogram cell will be mapped to the same colormap entry, namely the one
* closest to the cell's center.  This may not be quite the closest entry to
* the actual input color, but it's almost as good.  A zero in the cache
* indicates we haven't found the nearest color for that cell yet; the array
* is cleared to zeroes before starting the mapping pass.  When we find the
* nearest color for a cell, its colormap index plus one is recorded in the
* cache for future use.  The pass2 scanning routines call fill_inverse_cmap
* when they need to use an unfilled entry in the cache.
*
* Our method of efficiently finding nearest colors is based on the "locally
* sorted search" idea described by Heckbert and on the incremental distance
* calculation described by Spencer W. Thomas in chapter III.1 of Graphics
* Gems II (James Arvo, ed.  Academic Press, 1991).  Thomas points out that
* the distances from a given colormap entry to each cell of the histogram can
* be computed quickly using an incremental method: the differences between
* distances to adjacent cells themselves differ by a constant.  This allows a
* fairly fast implementation of the "brute force" approach of computing the
* distance from every colormap entry to every histogram cell.  Unfortunately,
* it needs a work array to hold the best-distance-so-far for each histogram
* cell (because the inner loop has to be over cells, not colormap entries).
* The work array elements have to be INT32s, so the work array would need
* 256Kb at our recommended precision.  This is not feasible in DOS machines.
*
* To get around these problems, we apply Thomas' method to compute the
* nearest colors for only the cells within a small subbox of the histogram.
* The work array need be only as big as the subbox, so the memory usage
* problem is solved.  Furthermore, we need not fill subboxes that are never
* referenced in pass2; many images use only part of the color gamut, so a
* fair amount of work is saved.  An additional advantage of this
* approach is that we can apply Heckbert's locality criterion to quickly
* eliminate colormap entries that are far away from the subbox; typically
* three-fourths of the colormap entries are rejected by Heckbert's criterion,
* and we need not compute their distances to individual cells in the subbox.
* The speed of this approach is heavily influenced by the subbox size: too
* small means too much overhead, too big loses because Heckbert's criterion
* can't eliminate as many colormap entries.  Empirically the best subbox
* size seems to be about 1/512th of the histogram (1/8th in each direction).
*
* Thomas' article also describes a refined method which is asymptotically
* faster than the brute-force method, but it is also far more complex and
* cannot efficiently be applied to small subboxes.  It is therefore not
* useful for programs intended to be portable to DOS machines.  On machines
* with plenty of memory, filling the whole histogram in one shot with Thomas'
* refined method might be faster than the present code --- but then again,
* it might not be any faster, and it's certainly more complicated.
