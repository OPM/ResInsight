ADDING A NEW FILE
-----------------
When adding a new .glsl file you MUST change the 'Item Type' of the file to 'C/C++ header' !!
Can be accessed through the Properties dialog under General for the relevant file.

This seems to be the current workaround to ensure that modifications to the .glsl
file will trigger a build which in turn will trigger the custom build step
that is configured for the LibRender project.

MODIFYING A FILE
-----------------
When a .glsl file is modified, the cvfShaderSourceStrings.h must be checked out (and committed afterwards)
