Documentation guidelines when writing Doxygen doc for CVC.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Ripped from: http://api.haiku-os.org/apidoc.html

Relevant paragraph commands in decreasing order of importance:

\attention
* Used when the developer is bound to make a mistake, when the API is ambiguous. 
  The difference between this and a warning is that warnings warn about things 
  that are the developers fault, and attention blocks warn about things that 
  might go wrong because of the way the API is structured.
* Used to warn for abuse of the API that might be caused by the way the internals 
  of the system are structured.

\warning
* Used to warn developers about using the API in a certain way. Warnings apply 
  especially to new developers that aren't completely familiar with the API and that 
  might want to abuse it. For example, the thread safety of BString requires a warning.

\note
* Used to place references to other documentation that might not be directly related 
  to the text. For example, BLooper will have a direct reference to BHandler in the 
  class description, but BMessenger will be mentioned in a note because it does not 
  directly influence the use of the class.
* Can also be used for useful hints or notes that somehow need to stand out from the 
  rest of the text.

\remark
* Remarks are small notes that would interrupt the flow of the text. For example, 
  if you in a text ignore a certain condition that is so extremely rare and uncommon, 
  you can put a remark at the end of the text to tell that you have been lying.
* Remarks interact with the text whereas notes add something unmentioned to it.


In newer versions of Doxygen it seems that these gets tagged with a color in the
final documentation. 
  RED      \attention 
  RED      \warning 
  YELLOW   \note
