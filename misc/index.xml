      <description>The Project File ResInsight stores all views and settings in a Project File with the extension *.rsp to easily continue work in a subsequent session. This file only contains references to the real data files, and does not in any way copy the data itself. Data files generated by ResInsight are also referenced by the Project File.
The *.rsp file is an XML file, and can be edited by any text editor.</description>

      <description>ResInsight can require a considerable amount of memory to hold all the grids and necessary result variables. If the requirements starts approaching the available physical memory on the workstation, ResInsight may become unstable and crash, as the operating system starts freeing memory to avoid system failure. To help alleviate this, ResInsight has some built-in memory management tools.
Memory Indicator The tools are available from the memory indicator in the bottom right corner of the main 3D window.</description>
