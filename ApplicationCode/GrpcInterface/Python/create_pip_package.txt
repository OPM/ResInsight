# 1. Make sure dist folder is clear
del dist/*
 
# 2. Update rips-version tag in setup.py (".N after ResInsight version"). This is generated from setup.py.cmake
#    So that you for instance have version 2019.08.1 of rips.
 
# 3. Build source distribution
python setup.py sdist
 
# 4. Test upload to test.pypi.org. This requires a ResInsight testpypi-user and you will be prompted for username and password
python -m twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
 
# 5. Test install rips module.
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ rips

# 6. Test the newly installed module

# 8. If anything is wrong, start again from 1. with an incremented rips-version (ResInsightVersion.2+)
# These incremented versions are just for testpypi and you can reset back to the wanted version before real upload

# 9. Upload to real Pypi. This requires a ResInsight pypi-user.
python -m twine upload dist/*
