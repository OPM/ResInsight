# ResInsight

ResInsight is an open source, cross-platform 3D visualization and post-processing tool for reservoir models and simulations.

## Key Features

- **Specialized Visualizations**: Tailored for efficient interpretation of reservoir simulation data with visualizations of properties, faults, and wells
- **Performance-Oriented**: Exploits multi-core CPUs and GPUs for highly responsive operation
- **Statistical Analysis**: Handles large numbers of realizations with built-in statistical calculations
- **Python Integration**: Enables powerful result manipulation and computations with two-way data exchange
- **GNU Octave Integration**: Enables powerful result manipulation and computations with two-way data exchange
- **Extensible Framework**: Supports additional data sources and visualization methods (solvers, seismic data, CSEM, geomechanics)
- **Eclipse Integration**: Supports export to Eclipse input formats for simulation cycles and parameter studies

## Supported Input Formats

- Eclipse binary output (*.GRID, *.EGRID files with corresponding *.INIT, *.XNNN, and *.UNRST files)
- Selected Eclipse input file sections
- Grid information with cell property data sets

## Technology Stack

ResInsight utilizes:
- **Equinor/resdata** and **OPM/opm-common** libraries for Eclipse result file access
- **Qt** for the application framework
- **Qwt** for plotting functionality
- **vcpkg** for dependency management

## Platform Support

ResInsight is cross-platform with automated testing on:
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
- Ubuntu
- Windows 11
