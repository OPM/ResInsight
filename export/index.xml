      <description>ResInsight has several commands to create snapshots conveniently. 3 commands to take snapshots of existing Plot and 3D Views directly, and a more advanced export command that can automatically modify Eclipse 3D Views before snapshotting them.
Snapshots of Existing Views The commands to snapshot existing views and plots are available from the toolbar and the Edit and File-&amp;gt;Export menus in the main windows Snapshot to Clipboard A snapshot of the active view is copied to the clipboard using Edit -&amp;gt; Copy Snapshot To Clipboard .</description>

      <description>Eclipse Properties can be exported to Eclipse ASCII files. This is particularly useful when a new property is generated using Octave. The generated property can be exported for further use in the simulator.
Export Command To export the property currently active in the 3D View, activate the right-click menu on a Cell Result item in the Project Tree.
The following dialog will appear:
 Export File Name &amp;ndash; The path to exported file Eclipse Keyword &amp;ndash; The keyword to use for the property in the eclipse file Undefined Value &amp;ndash; This value is written to the file for all values that are flagged as undefined in ResInsight  File Format The exported file has the following format, that matches the Eclipse input format:</description>

      <description>The visible cells can be exported as a FLUXNUM or MULTNUM keyword that can be used in an Eclipse input data deck.
You can do this by using the command Export Visible Cells as FLUXNUM/MULTNUM found by right clicking:
 View in the Project Tree. Cell Result in the Project Tree. In any Eclipse 3D View.  The command can also be found in File -&amp;gt; Export. If the command is used in the project tree, the visible cells from the selected view are used for calculation.</description>

      <description>The completions defined in ResInsight can be exported to Eclipse for use in new simulation runs. The commands Export Completion Data For Visible Wells, Export Completion Data For Visible Simulation Wells and Export Completion Data For Selected Wells can be used to invoke the export. The commands are available by right clicking Well Paths or Simulation Wells in the Project Tree. The first command is available from the File-&amp;gt;Import menu as well.</description>

      <description>In order to export well paths to dev files, select the menu item File -&amp;gt; Export -&amp;gt; Export Visible Well Paths or select one or more well paths and then select one of the items in the sub menu Export Well Paths.
A dialog appears after selecting an export well path command.
 Export Folder - Folder for the exported well path file(s). The folder will be created when performing the export and the names of the exported file(s) will be on the format &amp;lt;well name&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>Sub-sections of the Eclipse Grid with Parameters and Faults can be exported to Eclipse ASCII files in order to create new Simulations on the sub-section.
Exporting an Eclipse Sector Model To launch the export dialog, right-click on either the 3D-view in question or the Cell Result.
Exporting Grid and Faults Grid Export The Export dialog will allow the user to export grid data as ascii (An Eclipse Input Grid) to a specific file name by checking the Export Grid Data option.</description>

      <description>ResInsight can create contour maps based on different forms of aggregation of 3D Eclipse data onto a 2D Plane. Any 3D result value can be aggregated, in addition to specialised results, such as oil, gas and hydrocarbon columns. A Contour Map is a specialised 2D view with many of the same features as the 3D views, including property filters, range filters and display of faults and wells.
Export of Contour Map Data To export a contour map, invoke one of the following options (c.</description>
