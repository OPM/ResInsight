      <description>Introduction To identify a ResInsight case uniquely in the Octave script, an integer Id (CaseId) is used. This Id can be retrieved in several ways, but there are two main modes of operation regarding this for a particular octave script: Either the script is designed to work on a single case (the &amp;ldquo;Current Case&amp;rdquo;), or the script is designed to access the selection and traverse the cases by itself.
Note: The Octave interface does not support Geomechanical cases and flow diagnostic results.</description>

      <description>Intersections are cross sections of the grid model that displays the grid cell values on planes that cut through the grid in various ways.
There are two main types of intersections. The first one which simply is called Intersection, is defined by a piece-wise linear curve and an extrusion direction. The curve can be either a Simulation Well, a Well Path, a user defined polyline, or a user defined line. These intersections can also be shown in their own separate 2D Intersection View</description>
