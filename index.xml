      <description>Summary data can be imported as a single summary file or an ensemble of summary files.
Basic Summary Import Summary data is located in two files, summary vector names in *.SMSPEC and curve data in *.UNSMRY.
For import of ensemble datasets, see Ensemble File Dialog.
Origin Files During summary file import, ResInsight checks whether the summary file is restarted, i.e. has an origin file. If an origin file is found, the Origin Files dialog is displayed.</description>

      <description>Ensemble File Import When using the standard file selection dialog, the user is limited to select files in one directory only. If the interesting files are distributed over multiple directories, the dialog has to be opened once for each directory. The recursive file selection dialog is created to circumvent this limitation. This dialog is able to search a directory tree for files matching a specified pattern.
This dialog is used for import of different file types like *.</description>

      <description>Grid Calculations Grid Property Calculations can now be applied to multiple grid cases. A grid calculation can be used as data source for Grid Case Statistics. The data source for statistics computations can either be a cell property or a grid calculation expression. Time step selection is added to the Grid Case Statistics settings to reduce computation demand. Expressions can be stored to a file and loaded from a file. This makes it possible to reuse expressions in multiple projects.</description>

      <description>Introduction To identify a ResInsight case uniquely in the Octave script, an integer Id (CaseId) is used. This Id can be retrieved in several ways, but there are two main modes of operation regarding this for a particular octave script: Either the script is designed to work on a single case (the &amp;ldquo;Current Case&amp;rdquo;), or the script is designed to access the selection and traverse the cases by itself.
Note: The Octave interface does not support Geomechanical cases and flow diagnostic results.</description>
