      <description>User Interface ResInsight has two main windows, one for 3D related visualizations and one for 2D graphs and plots.
3D Main Window Plot Main Window Switching Between the Two Main Windows The two main windows has a toolbar button each, that directly opens and raises the other window. Each of the windows can also be closed freely, but if both are closed, ResInsight exits.
Docking Windows Each of the main windows has a central area and several docking windows surrounding it.</description>

      <description>3D Views are the windows displaying the Grid Models. The visualization is controlled by the Project Tree item representing the View and their sub items.
Each item has a set of properties that can be edited in the Property Editor.
Several views can be added to the same case by right-clicking the case or a view and select New View. You can also Copy and then Paste a view into a Case.</description>

      <description>ResInsight supports the following type of Eclipse input data:
 *.GRID and *.EGRID files along with their *.INIT and restart files *.XNNN and *.UNRST. Grid and Property data from *.GRDECL files.  Release 2018.11 supports import of simulations from Intersect. To be able to import into ResInsight, the Intersect simulation must be exported into Eclipse file format.
Eclipse Results ResInsight offers several ways to import Eclipse (grid) files. Use one of the following commands in the File-&amp;gt;Import-&amp;gt;Eclipse Cases menu:</description>

      <description>In this section the different settings that controls the default behavior of ResInsight is described. These settings can be controlled using the Preference dialog available from the Edit -&amp;gt; Preferences menu.
When changing the preferences, any default color, font or Z-scale Factor that has not been changed by the user in the various views, will be applied immediately. If the user has changed font sizes in specific plots or annotations from the default value, ResInsight will ask if the user wants the new defaults applied to all existing views and plots even where custom settings have been set.</description>

      <description>A Summary Plot is a window displaying a graph in the main area of the Plot Main Window. As described below, a Summary Plot can contain Summary Curves, Grid time history curves, and pasted ascii curves.
A new Summary Plot can be created by using the right-click menu of Summary Plots in the Plot Project Tree and activate Open Summary Plot Editor or New Summary Plot.
If you have many open plots, it can be useful to collapse all other plots by activating Collapse Other Plots from right-click menu of a plot in the Plot Project Tree.</description>

      <description>Log ASCII Standard (LAS) is a standard file format common in the oil-and-gas industry to store well log information.
Importing a LAS file Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files can be imported using the command: File-&amp;gt;Import-&amp;gt; Well Data-&amp;gt;Import Well Logs from File.
ResInsight will look for the the well name in the imported LAS-files among the existing Well Paths. If a match is found, the LAS-file is placed as a child of that well path.</description>

      <description>The main results to post process in ResInsight are Cell Results. A Cell Result is one value, or a small set of values per cell over a region of the grid. A Cell Result is also referred to as a Property.
Cell Results are used in several operations and settings:
 Cell Colors Cell Edge Result (Eclipse Only) Separate Fault Result (Eclipse Only) Property Filters Well Log Extraction Curves Cell Result Time History Curves  In the property panel of all those, the same options are used to define the Cell Result of interest.</description>

      <description>ResInsight can require a considerable amount of memory to hold all the grids and necessary result variables. If the requirements starts approaching the available physical memory on the workstation, ResInsight may become unstable and crash, as the operating system starts freeing memory to avoid system failure. To help alleviate this, ResInsight has some built-in memory management tools.

      <description>Dependencies and Prerequisites vcpkg can be used to install grpc for C++. This method is cross platform, and can be easier to use than directly installing grpc and dependencies directly from grpc source code. The source code for vcpkg is avaialable as a Git sub module in the folder &amp;lsquo;vcpkg&amp;rsquo;. Python3 is required.
vcpkg requires relatively new versions of git and compiler.

      <description>ResInsight offers a Comparison View to compare two existing views in terms of grid geometry, results, intersections and more. The Comparison View allows comparison of information of different grids and different solutions on the same grid in a single view. This improves efficiency and simplifies the workflow when working with related but different models.
The figure above exemplifies a Comparison View for comparison of two different simulations models and results. The left hand side is used to display grid and results of an Eclipse simulation while the right hand side displays an ABAQUS grid and simulation results from geomechanical analysis.</description>

      <description>A Summary Cross Plot is a window displaying a graph in the main area of the Plot Main Window. It is very similar to an ordinary Summary Plot, but there are some differences:
 Summary Cross Plot displays one vector against another vector, not one vector against time. Not possible to paste Excel/CSV data to a summary cross plot. Summary cross plots have no Plot Editor.  The only way to create a new Summary Cross Plot, is to select the right-click command New Summary Cross Plot on the Plot Main Window -&amp;gt; Project Tree -&amp;gt; Summary Cross Plots item.</description>

      <description>Introduction To identify a ResInsight case uniquely in the Octave script, an integer Id (CaseId) is used. This Id can be retrieved in several ways, but there are two main modes of operation regarding this for a particular octave script: Either the script is designed to work on a single case (the &amp;ldquo;Current Case&amp;rdquo;), or the script is designed to access the selection and traverse the cases by itself.
Note: The Octave interface does not support Geomechanical cases and flow diagnostic results.</description>

      <description>Intersections are cross sections of the grid model that displays the grid cell values on planes that cut through the grid in various ways.
There are two main types of intersections. The first one which simply is called Intersection, is defined by a piece-wise linear curve and an extrusion direction. The curve can be either a Simulation Well, a Well Path, a user defined polyline, or a user defined line. These intersections can also be shown in their own separate 2D Intersection View</description>

      <description>ResInsight is an open source, cross-platform 3D visualization, curve plotting and post processing tool for Eclipse reservoir models and simulations. It can also be configured to visualize geomechanical simulations from ABAQUS.
The system also constitutes a framework for further development and can be extended to support new data sources and visualization methods, e.g. additional solvers, seismic data, CSEM, and more.
Efficient User Interface The user interface is tailored for efficient interpretation of reservoir simulation data with specialized visualizations of properties, faults and wells.</description>
