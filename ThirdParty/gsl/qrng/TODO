* Sort out "const" in prototypes, it looks odd since there are consts
for many functions which modify the state.  (Applies to both qrng and rng)

*  It would be useful to include functions to generate quasi-random
  number distributions (at least the Gaussian distribution)? obviously
  the Box-Mueller algorithm cannot be used to maintain the low
  discrepancy characteristics of the sequence, there are several
  methods suggested in the literature but it isn't at all my field so
  I'm not sure which is to be preferred. (DENISON Francis
