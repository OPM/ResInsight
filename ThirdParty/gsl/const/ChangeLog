2009-08-17  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el: removed electromagnetic constants from cgs, now only
	in CGSM

2008-07-03  Brian Gough  <bjg@hp2.network-theory.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): use top_srcdir instead of top_builddir

2006-03-21  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test.c (main): added some extra tests

2006-03-17  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-electrical-constants): added debye unit

2004-05-26  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test.c: added stdlib.h for exit()

2004-03-05  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el: added CGS and MKS systems back in, with CGSM electrical
	units excluded from CGS, for backwards compatibility
	
2003-11-27  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-constants): added stefan-boltzmann constant and
	thomson cross section

2003-09-18  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test.c: added a test program

	* gsl_const.h: fixed to use new header files for MKSA and CGSM

2003-06-09  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* calc-units-update.el: changed to use MKSA and CGSM units, so
	that electromagnetic constants are converted correctly

Sat Jul 20 21:25:56 2002  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* calc-units-update.el (math-additional-units): changed setvar to
 	setq, otherwise the new values do not override the original values

Wed May 29 22:41:31 2002  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* calc-units-update.el (math-additional-units): updated unit
 	values, in a backwards compatible way.  Made mue an absolute
 	value, and put Ryd in energy units.
	
2002-05-18  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@unc.edu>

	* calc-units-update.el (math-additional-units): Add this file to
	provide updated costants for Emacs calc.  (These values are in the
	current development versions of GNU Emacs and Xemacs already.)

Mon Apr  1 19:27:57 2002  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-constants): Added newton, dyne, joule, erg and
 	power-of-ten prefixes, Mega, Giga, Tera, etc.

Tue Jan  8 21:48:56 2002  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-constants): added bohr_radius and
 	vacuum_permittivity

Tue Sep 25 15:15:33 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (fn): make all output double precision to avoid
 	possibility of unexpected integer division.
	(gsl-constants): fix definition of barn and btu
	(gsl-constants): added solar mass

Tue Jan 23 16:19:50 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* const.el (gsl-constants): fixed definition of POINT (from pt to
 	point, was previously measuring 'pints')
