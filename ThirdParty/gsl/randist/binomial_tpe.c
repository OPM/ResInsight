/* The binomial distribution has the form,

   f(x) =  n!/(x!(n-x)!) * p^x (1-p)^(n-x) for integer 0 <= x <= n
        =  0                               otherwise

   This implementation follows the public domain ranlib function
   "ignbin", the bulk of which is the BTPE (Binomial Triangle
   Parallelogram Exponential) algorithm introduced in
   Kachitvichyanukul and Schmeiser[1].  It has been translated to use
   modern C coding standards.

   If n is small and/or p is near 0 or near 1 (specifically, if
   n*min(p,1-p) < SMALL_MEAN), then a different algorithm, called
   BINV, is used which has an average runtime that scales linearly
   with n*min(p,1-p).

   But for larger problems, the BTPE algorithm takes the form of two
   functions b(x) and t(x) -- "bottom" and "top" -- for which b(x) <
   f(x)/f(M) < t(x), with M = floor(n*p+p).  b(x) defines a triangular
   region, and t(x) includes a parallelogram and two tails.  Details
   (including a nice drawing) are in the paper.

   [1] Kachitvichyanukul, V. and Schmeiser, B. W.  Binomial Random
   Variate Generation.  Communications of the ACM, 31, 2 (February,
   1988) 216.

   Note, Bruce Schmeiser (personal communication) points out that if
   you want very fast binomial deviates, and you are happy with
   approximate results, and/or n and n*p are both large, then you can
   just use gaussian estimates: mean=n*p, variance=n*p*(1-p).

   This implementation by James Theiler, April 2003, after obtaining
   permission -- and some good advice -- from Drs. Kachitvichyanukul
   and Schmeiser to use their code as a starting point, and then doing
   a little bit of tweaking.
