2009-07-11  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* quad_golden.c: added new safeguarded step-length algorithm from
	James Howse

2009-07-09  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* fsolver.c (gsl_min_fminimizer_free): handle NULL argument in free

2008-07-03  Brian Gough  <bjg@hp2.network-theory.co.uk>

	* Makefile.am (INCLUDES): use top_srcdir instead of top_builddir

2008-01-09  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* brent.c (brent_iterate): remove spurious early return

2007-07-30  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* min.h (SAFE_FUNC_CALL): use gsl_finite instead of finite

2005-09-09  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* min.h: improved error message, function can be discontinuous
	despite what error message said.
	
2005-04-28  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* brent.c (brent_iterate): fixed error in ordering of tests for
	updates so that it agrees with Brent's book.

2004-04-13  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* brent.c (brent_iterate): corrected condition for setting to
	+/-tolerance.

Sun Apr  7 15:22:11 2002  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* fsolver.c (gsl_min_fminimizer_x_minimum): new function,
 	obsoletes gsl_min_fminimizer_minimum.
	(gsl_min_fminimizer_f_minimum): new function for accessing
 	function values
	(gsl_min_fminimizer_f_lower): new function for accessing function
 	values
	(gsl_min_fminimizer_f_upper): new function for accessing function
 	values

	* renamed minimum to x_minimum throughout

Wed Oct  3 11:35:45 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test.c (main): added an extra test

Sun Jul 15 17:53:26 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* eliminated interval type, changed order of arguments to set
 	functions

Tue Apr 17 22:13:58 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* fsolver.c (gsl_min_fminimizer_alloc): removed unnecessary status
 	variable

Mon Apr  2 14:54:33 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* brent.c (brent_init): fixed incorrect value for golden ratio
	(brent_iterate): fixed incorrect value for golden ratio

	* golden.c (goldensection_iterate): fixed incorrect value for
 	golden ratio

	* bracketing.c (gsl_min_find_bracket): fixed incorrect value for
 	golden ratio

Sun Feb 18 11:43:04 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* fsolver.c: changed so that the solver _alloc function no longer
 	calls _set, the user must do that separately.

Fri May  5 16:09:11 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test.c (test_bracket): fixed warning about "control reaches end
 	of non-void function" by changing return type to void

Tue Feb 15 16:32:55 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* bracketing.c (gsl_min_find_bracket): changed counter nb_eval
 	from type int to type size_t in order to avoid comparison between
 	signed and unsigned, (nb_eval < eval_max).

Mon Feb 14 13:07:43 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* made all internal functions static

Wed Oct 13 16:08:03 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* rewritten to allow initial values to be specified
