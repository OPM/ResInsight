* BUG#14 -- qagil

The extrapolation used in qags gives negative results when integrating
the small tails of probability distributions using qagil, even though
each individual term in the sequence is positive and increasing (!).
This is a feature of the original quadpack and appears to be due to
the extrapolation algorithm, which should probably be tweaked to avoid
this undesirable behavior.

  been ported
