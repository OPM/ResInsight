 	variable

Sun Feb 18 15:35:25 2001  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* fdfsolver.c fsolver.c: changed so that the solver _alloc
 	function no longer calls _set, the user must do that separately.

Wed May 17 11:37:15 2000  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* test_macros.c (test_macros): use GSL_POSINF and GSL_NAN macros

	* made all internal functions static

Wed Nov  3 11:59:35 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* fixed test failures

	* test.c (main): added a call to gsl_ieee_env_setup for testing

	* test_roots.c: increased the maximum number of iterations to 150
 	so that the tests still work on the difficult cases.

	* steffenson.c (steffenson_iterate): add a check to avoid division
 	by zero

Sat Oct 16 19:43:14 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

Wed Jul 21 18:47:01 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* gsl_roots.h, convergence.c: changed order of relative and
 	absolute errors to make them the same as quadpack routines
 	(abs,rel)

Wed Jul 21 16:30:56 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@network-theory.co.uk>

	* brent.c (brent_iterate): fixed bug where bounding interval could
 	be incorrect and not include root.

Mon Mar  1 15:38:06 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* moved static class data out of gsl_root_fsolver and
 	gsl_root_fdfsolver and into gsl_root_fsolver_type and
 	gsl_root_fdfsolver_type

 
Mon Mar  1 15:38:06 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* renamed f_solver to fsolver and fdf_solver to fdfsolver, since
 	these look neater

Sun Feb 28 21:11:21 1999  Brian Gough  <bjg@netsci.freeserve.co.uk>

	* rewrote the root finding functions in an iterative framework

Tue Nov 17 16:47:09 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* secant.c, falsepos.c newton.c: added gsl_math.h to included
 	headers to import GSL_MAX and GSL_MIN

Mon Nov  9 21:21:45 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* roots.h: got rid of local MAX(a,b) and MIN(a,b) definitions
 	since they are now in config.h

Wed Nov  4 16:08:32 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* test.c (test_brent): allow the brent tests to run for more
 	iterations since they take longer on the pathological cases.

	* brent.c (gsl_root_brent): on each iteration keep track of
 	current best estimates of the root and the bounds so that they are
 	returned to the user if the function exits prematurely.

	clean up the brent algorithm based on remarks in the original
 	paper

Mon Oct 26 16:31:21 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* in all routines with upper and lower bounds if a root is found
 	exactly then the bracket is collapsed onto the root instead of
 	being untouched.

Thu Oct 15 13:59:30 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* bisection.c, falsepos.c, secant.c: reordered the tests so that
 	the minimum number of function evaluations are performed when
 	there is an early exit due to one of the supplied limits lying on
 	a root.

Fri Aug 21 14:48:13 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* test.c: clean up of tests to get rid of warnings

Thu Aug 20 10:21:15 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* roots.h (_WITHIN_TOL): added extra parens in macro definition,
 	for safety

	* falsepos.c (gsl_root_falsepos): removed test for absolute
 	equality and replaced by a flag indicating which variables
 	changed.

	* test.c (main): simplified the tests, removed command line
 	arguments (can use the debugger to select which ones to run)

Mon Jun 15 22:22:54 1998  Brian Gough  <bjg@vvv.lanl.gov>

	* started to eliminate void * arguments for function types (they
 	are not a good idea and can easily be specified)

1998-02-09  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* test.c (main): added an extra argument so that the $(srcdir) can
	be passed along when "make check" is run in a separate build
	directory.

	* test-macros, test-secant, test-bisection, test-newton,
	test-falsepos: modified these to use build and source directories
	explicitly.  Now "make check" in a separate build directory works.

1998-02-02  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (TESTS): added $(srcdir) before these scripts, since
	the TESTS target picks things from the build directory.
