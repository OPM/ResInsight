.SH NAME
gsl-randist - generate random samples from various distributions
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B gsl-randist seed n DIST param1 param2 [..]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gsl-randist 
is a demonstration program for the GNU Scientific Library.
It generates n random samples from the distribution DIST using the distribution
parameters param1, param2, ...
.SH EXAMPLE
Here is an example.  We generate 10000 random samples from a Cauchy
distribution with a width of 30 and histogram them over the range -100 to
100, using 200 bins.
 
     gsl-randist 0 10000 cauchy 30 | gsl-histogram -100 100 200 > histogram.dat
 
A plot of the resulting histogram will show the familiar shape of the
Cauchy distribution with fluctuations caused by the finite sample
size.

     awk '{print $1, $3 ; print $2, $3}' histogram.dat | graph -T X
