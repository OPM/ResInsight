.SH NAME
gsl-histogram - compute histogram of data on stdin
.SH SYNOPSYS
.B gsl-histogram xmin xmax [n]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gsl-histogram 
is a demonstration program for the GNU Scientific Library.
It takes three arguments, specifying the upper and lower bounds of the
histogram and the number of bins.  It then reads numbers from `stdin',
one line at a time, and adds them to the histogram.  When there is no
more data to read it prints out the accumulated histogram using
gsl_histogram_fprintf.  If n is unspecified then bins of integer width
are used.
.SH EXAMPLE
Here is an example.  We generate 10000 random samples from a Cauchy
distribution with a width of 30 and histogram them over the range -100 to
100, using 200 bins.
 
     gsl-randist 0 10000 cauchy 30 | gsl-histogram -100 100 200 > histogram.dat
 
A plot of the resulting histogram will show the familiar shape of the
Cauchy distribution with fluctuations caused by the finite sample
size.

     awk '{print $1, $3 ; print $2, $3}' histogram.dat | graph -T X
