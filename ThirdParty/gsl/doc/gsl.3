.SH NAME
gsl - GNU Scientific Library
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <gsl/...>
.SH DESCRIPTION
The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is a collection of routines for
numerical computing.  The routines are written from scratch by the GSL
team in C, and present a modern Applications Programming Interface
(API) for C programmers, allowing wrappers to be written for very high
level languages.

Complex Numbers
Roots of Polynomials
Special Functions
Vectors and Matrices
Permutations
Combinations
Sorting
BLAS Support
Linear Algebra
