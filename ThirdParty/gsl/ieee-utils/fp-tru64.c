/*
 * Under Compaq's Unix with the silly name, read the man pages for read_rnd,
 * write_rnd, and ieee(3) for more information on the functions used here.
 *
 * Note that enabling control of dynamic rounding mode (via write_rnd) requires
 * that you pass a special flag to your C compiler.  For Compaq's C compiler
 * the flag is `-fprm d', for gcc it's `-mfp-rounding-mode=d'.
 *
 * Enabling the trap control (via ieee_set_fp_control) also requires a
 * flag be passed to the C compiler.  The flag for Compaq's C compiler
 * is `-ieee' and for gcc it's `-mieee'.

 * We have not implemented the `inexact' case, since it is rarely used
 * and requires the library being built with an additional compiler
 * flag that can degrade performance for everything else. If you need
 * to add support for `inexact' the relevant flag for Compaq's
 * compiler is `-ieee_with_inexact', and the flag for gcc is
 * `-mieee-with-inexact'.
 *
 * Problem have been reported with the "fixed" float.h installed with
 * gcc-2.95 lacking some of the definitions in the system float.h (the
 * symptoms are errors like: `FP_RND_RN' undeclared). To work around
 * this we can include the system float.h before the gcc version, e.g. 
 *
 *  #include "/usr/include/float.h"
 *  #include <float.h>
