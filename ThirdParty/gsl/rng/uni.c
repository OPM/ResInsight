C***PURPOSE  THIS ROUTINE GENERATES QUASI UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERS ON [0,1
C             AND CAN BE USED ON ANY COMPUTER WITH WHICH ALLOWS INTEGERS
C             AT LEAST AS LARGE AS 32767.
C***DESCRIPTION
C
C       THIS ROUTINE GENERATES QUASI UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERS ON THE INTER
C       [0,1).  IT CAN BE USED WITH ANY COMPUTER WHICH ALLOWS
C       INTEGERS AT LEAST AS LARGE AS 32767.
C
C
C   USE
C       FIRST TIME....
C                   Z = UNI(JD)
C                     HERE JD IS ANY  N O N - Z E R O  INTEGER.
C                     THIS CAUSES INITIALIZATION OF THE PROGRAM
C                     AND THE FIRST RANDOM NUMBER TO BE RETURNED AS Z.
C       SUBSEQUENT TIMES...
C                   Z = UNI(0)
C                     CAUSES THE NEXT RANDOM NUMBER TO BE RETURNED AS Z.

C..................................................................
C   NOTE: USERS WHO WISH TO TRANSPORT THIS PROGRAM FROM ONE COMPUTER
C         TO ANOTHER SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION.....
C
C   MACHINE DEPENDENCIES...
C      MDIG = A LOWER BOUND ON THE NUMBER OF BINARY DIGITS AVAILABLE
C              FOR REPRESENTING INTEGERS, INCLUDING THE SIGN BIT.
C              THIS VALUE MUST BE AT LEAST 16, BUT MAY BE INCREASED
C              IN LINE WITH REMARK A BELOW.
C
C   REMARKS...
C     A. THIS PROGRAM CAN BE USED IN TWO WAYS:
C        (1) TO OBTAIN REPEATABLE RESULTS ON DIFFERENT COMPUTERS,
C            SET 'MDIG' TO THE SMALLEST OF ITS VALUES ON EACH, OR,
C        (2) TO ALLOW THE LONGEST SEQUENCE OF RANDOM NUMBERS TO BE
C            GENERATED WITHOUT CYCLING (REPEATING) SET 'MDIG' TO THE
C            LARGEST POSSIBLE VALUE.
C     B. THE SEQUENCE OF NUMBERS GENERATED DEPENDS ON THE INITIAL
C          INPUT 'JD' AS WELL AS THE VALUE OF 'MDIG'.
C          IF MDIG=16 ONE SHOULD FIND THAT
   Editors Note: set the seed using 152 in order to get uni(305)
   -jt
C            THE FIRST EVALUATION
C              Z=UNI(305) GIVES Z=.027832881...
C            THE SECOND EVALUATION
C              Z=UNI(0) GIVES   Z=.56102176...
C            THE THIRD EVALUATION
C              Z=UNI(0) GIVES   Z=.41456343...
C            THE THOUSANDTH EVALUATION
C              Z=UNI(0) GIVES   Z=.19797357...
