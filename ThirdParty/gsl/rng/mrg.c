/* This is a fifth-order multiple recursive generator. The sequence is,

   x_n = (a_1 x_{n-1} + a_5 x_{n-5}) mod m

   with a_1 = 107374182, a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = 0, a_5 = 104480 and m = 2^31-1.

   We initialize the generator with x_n = s_n MOD m for n = 1..5,
   where s_n = (69069 * s_{n-1}) mod 2^32, and s_0 = s is the
   user-supplied seed.

   NOTE: According to the paper the seeds must lie in the range [0,
   2^31 - 2] with at least one non-zero value -- our seeding procedure
   satisfies these constraints.

   We then use 6 iterations of the generator to "warm up" the internal
   state.

   With this initialization procedure the theoretical value of
   z_{10006} is 2064828650 for s = 1. The subscript 10006 means (1)
   seed the generator with s = 1, (2) do the 6 warm-up iterations
   that are part of the seeding process, (3) then do 10000 actual
   iterations.

   The period of this generator is about 2^155.

   multiple recursive random number generators", ACM Transactions on
   Modeling and Computer Simulation 3, 87-98 (1993). */
