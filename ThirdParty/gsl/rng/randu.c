/* This is a reincarnation of the infamously bad RANDU generator.
   The sequence is,

   x_{n+1} = (a x_n) mod m

   with a = 65539 and m = 2^31 = 2147483648. The seed specifies
   the initial value, x_1.

   The theoretical value of x_{10001} is 1623524161.

   The period of this generator is 2^29.

   Note: Knuth describes this generator as "really horrible". 

   From: Park and Miller, "Random Number Generators: Good ones are
   hard to find" Communications of the ACM, October 1988, Volume 31,
