/* This is a shift-register random number generator. The sequence is

   x_n = x_{n-103} ^ x_{n-250}        ("^" means XOR)

   defined on 32-bit words.

   BJG: Note that this implementation actually uses the sequence, x_n
   = x_{n-147} ^ x_{n-250} which generates the outputs in
   time-reversed order but is otherwise completely equivalent.

   The first 250 elements x_1 .. x_250 are first initialized as x_n =
   s_n, where s_n = (69069*s_{n-1}) mod 2^32 and s_0=s is the
   user-supplied seed. To ensure that the sequence does not lie on a
   subspace we force 32 of the entries to be linearly independent.  We
   take the 32 elements x[3], x[10], x[17], x[24], ..., 213 and apply
   the following operations,

   x[3]   &= 11111111111111111111111111111111
   x[3]   |= 10000000000000000000000000000000 
   x[10]  &= 01111111111111111111111111111111
   x[10]  |= 01000000000000000000000000000000 
   x[17]  &= 00111111111111111111111111111111
   x[17]  |= 00100000000000000000000000000000 
   ....      ...
   x[206] &= 00000000000000000000000000000111
   x[206] |= 00000000000000000000000000000100 
   x[213] &= 00000000000000000000000000000011
   x[213] |= 00000000000000000000000000000010 
   x[220] &= 00000000000000000000000000000001
   x[220] |= 00000000000000000000000000000001 

   i.e. if we consider the bits of the 32 elements as forming a 32x32
   array then we are setting the diagonal bits of the array to one and
   masking the lower triangle below the diagonal to zero.

   With this initialization procedure the theoretical value of
   x_{10001} is 1100653588 for s = 1 (Actually I got this by running
   the original code). The subscript 10001 means (1) seed the
   generator with s = 1 and then do 10000 actual iterations.

   The period of this generator is about 2^250.

   The algorithm works for any number of bits. It is implemented here
   for 32 bits.
