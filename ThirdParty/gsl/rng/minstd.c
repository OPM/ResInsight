/* MINSTD is Park and Miller's minimal standard generator (i.e. it's
   not particularly good).

   The sequence is

   x_{n+1} = (a x_n) mod m

   with a = 16807 and m = 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647. The seed specifies
   the initial value, x_1.  

   The theoretical value of x_{10001} is 1043618065, starting with a
   seed of x_1 = 1.

   The period of this generator is 2^31.

   It is used as the RNUN subroutine in the IMSL Library and the RAND
   function in MATLAB. The generator is sometimes known by the acronym
   "GGL" (I'm not sure what that stands for).

   From: Park and Miller, "Random Number Generators: Good ones are
   hard to find" Communications of the ACM, October 1988, Volume 31,
   No 10, pages 1192-1201. */
