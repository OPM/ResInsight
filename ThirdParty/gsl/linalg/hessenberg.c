/*
gsl_linalg_hessenberg_decomp()
  Compute the Householder reduction to Hessenberg form of a
square N-by-N matrix A.

H = U^t A U

See Golub & Van Loan, "Matrix Computations" (3rd ed), algorithm
7.4.2

Inputs: A   - matrix to reduce
        tau - where to store scalar factors in Householder
              matrices; this vector must be of length N,
              where N is the order of A

Return: GSL_SUCCESS unless error occurs

Notes: on output, the upper triangular portion of A (including
the diagaonal and subdiagonal) contains the Hessenberg matrix.
The lower triangular portion (below the subdiagonal) contains
the Householder vectors which can be used to construct
the similarity transform matrix U.

The matrix U is

U = U(1) U(2) ... U(n - 2)

where

U(i) = I - tau(i) * v(i) * v(i)^t

and the vector v(i) is stored in column i of the matrix A
underneath the subdiagonal. So the first element of v(i)
is stored in row i + 2, column i, the second element at
row i + 3, column i, and so on.

Also note that for the purposes of computing U(i),
v(1:i) = 0, v(i + 1) = 1, and v(i+2:n) is what is stored in
column i of A beneath the subdiagonal.

Notes: 1) On input, V needs to be initialized. The Householder matrices

            V_out = V_in * U(1) * U(2) * ... * U(n - 2)

          so if you just want the product of the Householder matrices,

gsl_linalg_hessenberg_submatrix()

  This routine does the same thing as gsl_linalg_hessenberg(),
except that it operates on a submatrix of a larger matrix, but
updates the larger matrix with the Householder transformations.

For example, suppose

M = [ M_{11} | M_{12} | M_{13} ]
    [   0    |   A    | M_{23} ]
    [   0    |   0    | M_{33} ]

where M_{11} and M_{33} are already in Hessenberg form, and we
just want to reduce A to Hessenberg form. Applying the transformations
to A alone will cause the larger matrix M to lose its similarity
information. So this routine updates M_{12} and M_{23} as A gets
reduced.

Inputs: M   - total matrix
        A   - (sub)matrix to reduce
        top - row index of top of A in M
        tau - where to store scalar factors in Householder
              matrices; this vector must be of length N,
              where N is the order of A

Return: GSL_SUCCESS unless error occurs

Notes: on output, the upper triangular portion of A (including
the diagaonal and subdiagonal) contains the Hessenberg matrix.
The lower triangular portion (below the subdiagonal) contains
the Householder vectors which can be used to construct
the similarity transform matrix U.

The matrix U is

U = U(1) U(2) ... U(n - 2)

where

U(i) = I - tau(i) * v(i) * v(i)^t

and the vector v(i) is stored in column i of the matrix A
underneath the subdiagonal. So the first element of v(i)
is stored in row i + 2, column i, the second element at
row i + 3, column i, and so on.

Also note that for the purposes of computing U(i),
v(1:i) = 0, v(i + 1) = 1, and v(i+2:n) is what is stored in
column i of A beneath the subdiagonal.
