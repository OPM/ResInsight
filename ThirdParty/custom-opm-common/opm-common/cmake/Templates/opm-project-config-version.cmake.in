# - CMake version file for @opm-project_NAME@
#
# Determine if requested version matches exactly or is compatible with
# the installed package. It sets the following variables:
#
#	PACKAGE_VERSION             Full provided version string
#	PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE  True if version is compatible
#	PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT       True if version is exact match

# This file is used by find_package to see if the installed version of a
# package can be used by the client, before the main -config.cmake file
# is loaded.
# see <http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Tutorials/Packaging#Package_Version_Files>

# this is the version that is installed
set (PACKAGE_VERSION @opm-project_VERSION@)

# if we wanted this exact version, then everything's fine
if (PACKAGE_VERSION VERSION_EQUAL PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION)
  set (PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT TRUE)
endif (PACKAGE_VERSION VERSION_EQUAL PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION)

# in general, we assume that there is going to be API breakage between
# released versions; this will hopefully change in the future
## compatible versions
#if (NOT PACKAGE_VERSION VERSION_LESS PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION)
#  set (PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE TRUE)
#endif (NOT PACKAGE_VERSION VERSION_LESS PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION)
