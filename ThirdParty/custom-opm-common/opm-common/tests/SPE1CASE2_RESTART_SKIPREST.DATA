WELLDIMS
-- Item 1: maximum number of wells in the model

-- Item 2: maximum number of grid blocks connected to any one well
-- 	   - must be one as the wells are located at specific grid blocks
-- Item 3: maximum number of groups in the model
-- 	   - we are dealing with only one 'group'
-- Item 4: maximum number of wells in any one group

PVTW
-- Item 1: pressure reference (psia)
-- Item 2: water FVF (rb per bbl or rb per stb)
-- Item 3: water compressibility (psi^{-1})
-- Item 4: water viscosity (cp)
-- Item 5: water 'viscosibility' (psi^{-1})

-- Using values from Norne:
-- In METRIC units:

-- In FIELD units:
    	4017.55 1.038 3.22E-6 0.318 0.0 /

ROCK
-- Item 1: reference pressure (psia)
-- Item 2: rock compressibility (psi^{-1})

-- Using values from table 1 in Odeh:
	14.7 3E-6 /

SWOF
-- Column 1: water saturation
--   	     - this has been set to (almost) equally spaced values from 0.12 to 1
-- Column 2: water relative permeability
--   	     - generated from the Corey-type approx. formula
--	       the coeffisient is set to 10e-5, S_{orw}=0 and S_{wi}=0.12
-- Column 3: oil relative permeability when only oil and water are present
--	     - we will use the same values as in column 3 in SGOF.
-- 	       This is not really correct, but since only the first 
--	       two values are of importance, this does not really matter
-- Column 4: corresponding water-oil capillary pressure (psi)

-- Warning from Eclipse: first sat. value in SWOF + last sat. value in SGOF
-- 	   		 must not be greater than 1, but Eclipse still runs
-- Flow needs the sum to be excactly 1 so I added a row with gas sat. =  0.88

PVDG
-- Column 1: gas phase pressure (psia)
-- Column 2: gas formation volume factor (rb per Mscf)

-- It is required to enter data for undersaturated oil for the highest GOR
-- (i.e. the last row) in the PVTO table.
-- In order to fulfill this requirement, values for oil FVF and viscosity
-- at 9014.7psia and GOR=1.618 for undersaturated oil have been approximated:
-- It has been assumed that there is a linear relation between the GOR
-- and the FVF when keeping the pressure constant at 9014.7psia.
-- From Odeh we know that (at 9014.7psia) the FVF is 2.357 at GOR=2.984
-- for saturated oil and that the FVF is 1.579 at GOR=1.27 for undersaturated oil,
-- so it is possible to use the assumption described above. 
-- An equivalent approximation for the viscosity has been used.

SOLUTION
-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESTART
   'SPE1CASE2' 60 /

RSVD
-- Dissolved GOR is initially constant with depth through the reservoir.
-- The reason is that the initial reservoir pressure given is higher 
---than the bubble point presssure of 4014.7psia, meaning that there is no 
-- free gas initially present.
