# opm-common: Tools for Eclipse reservoir simulation files

The Open Porous Media (OPM) software suite provides libraries and
tools for modeling and simulation of porous media processes,
especially  for simulating CO2 sequestration and improved and enhanced
oil recovery. The Eclipse file format is widely used in the reservoir
simulation  community. This package provides a library containing code
for processing files in Eclipse format, Python binding for accessing
Eclipse files and  utility code used by other OPM modules (e.g. CMake
modules used).
