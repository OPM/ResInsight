The enkf program uses an object call path_fmt_type to store/configure
various paths and filenames (The path_fmt_type is implemented in the
libutil library). For instance the main configuration file must
contain a line like this:

   RUNPATH   /tmp/Eclipse/tmpdir_%04d

This is actually a format string, so when we want to get/make a
directory for an eclipse simulation, the %04d is replaced with the
actual ensemble member. Usage example:

/* This is common to all members in the ensemble */
path_fmt_type * run_path_fmt = path_fmt_alloc_directory_fmt("/tmp/Eclipse/tmpdir_%04d" , true);   
...
...
/* For a spesific member: */
{
   char * run_path = path_fmt_alloc_path(run_path_fmt , iens);

}
