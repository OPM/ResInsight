When plotting summary vectors for which observations have been 'installed' with the <b>Observation config</b>, ERT will plot the observed values. If the number of observations is less than <b>Errorbar max</b>, ERT will use errorbars to show the observed values, otherwise it will use two dashed lines indicating +/- one standard deviation.
<br/>
To ensure that you always get errorbars you can set <b>Errorbar max</b> to a very large value. On the other hand, setting <b>Errorbar max</b> to zero will ensure that ERT always plots observation uncertainty using dashed lines of +/- one standard deviation.
<br/>
The setting here will also affect the output when you are using the TEXT driver to plot.
