When the ERT application runs the EnKF algorithm, it will use ECLIPSE to simulate one report step at a time, and do an update after each step. However, in some cases it will be beneficial to turn off the EnKF update for some report steps or to skip some steps completely. <b>ENKF schedule file</b> can point to a file with a more advanced schedule for when to perform the updates. This is optional.
