The <b>Init section</b> is used to handle initialization of the ECLIPSE run.
This can be used in two different ways:
<ul>
<li>If it is set to the name of an existing file, the contents of this file will be used for the initialization.
<li>If it is set to the name of a non-existing file, it will be assumed that a file with this name in the simulation folder will be generated when simulations are submitted, either by the ERT application itself, or by some job installed by the user. This generated file will then be used by ECLIPSE for initialization. 
</ul>
