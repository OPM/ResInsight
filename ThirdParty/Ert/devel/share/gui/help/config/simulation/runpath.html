The <b>Runpath</b> should give the name of the folders where the
ECLIPSE simulations are to be executed. It should contain at least one
%d-specifier, which will be replaced by the realization number when
ERT creates the folders. <br/> <br/>

Optionally, the Runpath can contain two more %d specifers, which will
be replaced by the first and last report step of the simulation. By
default, Runpath is set to "simulations/realization%d".  <br/> <br/>

When running with LSF it is essential that the <b>Runpath</b> points
to a network disk which is accessible with the same path from all the
nodes in the cluster.
