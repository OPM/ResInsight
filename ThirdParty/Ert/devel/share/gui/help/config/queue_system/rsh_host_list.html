To use the RSH queue system you must first set a list of computers which ERT can use for running jobs. The first column takes the computer names, the second takes the number of jobs for each computer. <br/> 

When using the RSH option, note the following: <ol>
  <li> You <i>must</i> have passwordless login to the computers listed in the <b>Host List</b>. </li>
  <li> ERT will not consider the total load on the various computers; if having said a computer can take two jobs, it will get two jobs, irrespective of the existing load. </li>
</ol>
