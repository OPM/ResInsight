The <b>Fields</b> are parametrizations of quantities which have extent over the full grid. The fields can represent both dynamic properties (e.g pressure or saturations), and static properties (e.g porosity). </br>
<dl>
<dt><b>Dynamic:</b>
<dd>The name of a dynamic field must coincide with the name found in the ECLIPSE restart file, e.g <code>PRESSURE</code>.
<dt><b>Parameter:</b>
<dd>A parameter field represents a static property (e.g porosity or permeability). Here the name can be an arbitrary string.
<dt><b>General:</b>
<dd>Using a general field, you have fine-grained control over input/output. This is only relevant for advanced features.
