This directory contains some tests which can be used to test a local
ert-python installation before installing. To be certain that you are
actually testing the Python installation you are working on, and not
picking up previously installed versions you must make sure that:

  1. The path $ERT-ROOT/devel/python/python is on the front of your
     $PYTHONPATH environment variable.

  2. That the python modules will find the shared libraries built as
     part of your build process. This is achieved by adding a link
     $ERT-ROOT/devel/python/lib64 pointing to the $ERT-BUILD/lib64
     area; where $ERT-BUILD is wherever you have compiled ert.

The scripts local_bash and local_csh will update your environment with
a correct value of $PYTHONPATH:

   ps1> source local_xxx

The lib64 link can not be made automagically, because your personal
build area could be anywhere. However the script will check that a
directory link lib64 exists and print a warning if not.
