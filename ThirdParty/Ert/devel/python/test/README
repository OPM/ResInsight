This directory contains some tests which can be used to test a local
ert-python installation before installing. To make sure you are indeed
using the local copies you must source one of the scripts 'local_bash'
or 'local_csh' with the command:

   ps1> source local_xxx

first.

The local scripts will:

  1. Create a directory lib and populate lib with symbolic links to
     all the required shared libraries.

  2. Create a symbolic link ../ert/util/pycfile.so -> ../../C/libpycfile/slib/libpycfile.so 

  3. Create symbolic link lib/ert -> ../../ert for importing python modules.

  4. Update the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables
     to ensure that the Python modules and shared libraries will be found.

Observe that in a production setting one would probably not put the
Python modules and the shared C libraries in the same directory.
