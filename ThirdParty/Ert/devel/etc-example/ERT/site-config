-- This file is an example of site-wide configuration file for
-- ERT. Observe that the user can override/add to everything which is set
-- in this file in her per-project configuration file. Observe that
-- prior to parsing this file ERT will issue a chdir() system call to
-- the location of this file, i.e. you can safely use paths relative
-- to the location of this file.


-- Setting configuration information about the LSF system:
LSF_QUEUE           normal
MAX_RUNNING_LSF     20
LSF_RESOURCES       select[cs && x86_64Linux] rusage[ecl100v2000=1:duration=5]


-- Setting configuration information for running with rsh/ssh between
-- workstations. Observe that to actually use this option the user
-- must in addition specify which workstations to use in her project
-- specific configuration file like:
-- RSH_HOST_LIST   host1:2  host2:4  host3:4
-- Which will run up to two jobs on 'host1' and four jobs on 'host2'
-- and 'host3'; in addition it is essential to have passwordless login
-- to the hosts 'hostx'.
MAX_RUNNING_RSH     100  -- You will never get more than the hosts allow anyway.
RSH_COMMAND         /usr/bin/ssh


-- Configuration for running the local workstation:
MAX_RUNNING_LOCAL   4


-- Which queue system will we use?
QUEUE_SYSTEM        LSF

-- How many times will we submit a job before failing it. Setting this
-- to two means first one submit, and then one more.
MAX_SUBMIT          2

-- Not related to the conventional idea of a license - forget about it ....
LICENSE_PATH        license


-- The script used to run through the jobs in the forward model - a
-- very important script.
JOB_SCRIPT          Scripts/job_dispatch.py


-- Installing a couple of jobs. A site will typically have a much
-- longer list of available jobs. The arguments of the INSTALL_JOB
-- command are first the short name of the job, which will be used
-- to refer to the job when setting up the forward, and secondly a
-- file with more details on how to run this job. Each of these files
-- are used to populate on instance of ext_job_type which is
-- implemented in libjob_queue/src/ext_job.c.

-- You can set environment variables with the SETENV command. The
-- SETENV command understands $VAR, so you can also update variables.

-- The LSF variables must be set for LSF to work, this is similar to
-- sourcing a LSF configuration file.
SETENV              LSF_BINDIR      /LSF_PATH/bin
SETENV              LSF_LIBDIR      /LSF_PATH/lib
SETENV             XLSF_UIDDIR      /LSF_PATH/lib/uid

SETENV              LSF_ENVDIR      /LS_PATH/conf

-- In addition to SETENV you can also use UPDATE_PATH to update ':'
-- separated path related environment variables. UPDATE_PATH will
-- prepend the existing value of PATH with the new value.
