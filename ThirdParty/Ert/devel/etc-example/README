This directory contains some example configuration files / scripts for
ERT. This directory should typically be installed in shared location
where it is readably for everyone. The files/directories are:

ERT/site-config
---------------
This is the shared configuration file for all ERT users. 


ERT/Scripts
-----------
This is a collection of scripts. These are:

 o ERT/Scripts/job_dispatch.py - the executable program started by
   ERT, which again will start and run the other programs in the
   forward model. A very important script; the path to this script is
   set with the JOB_SCRIPT variable in the site-config file.

 o ERT/Scripts/run_eclipse.py: This a script to run ECLIPSE - nothing
   special about this. If you want to use this script, you must at the
   very least update the paths to the ECLIPSE binary.

 o ERT/Scripts/run_RMS_20xx: A script to run version 20xx of
   RMS. Observe that this script is specifically designed to work
   around a bug with exporting RMS datasets to a relative path; that
   bug is now fixed in RMS.


ERT/jobs/***
-------------
The files in directory ERT/jobs are job-description files which are
used to 'install' jobs into ERT. The directory ERT/jobs/ contains
small config files to install three different ECLIPSE jobs. (Make the
effort and understand the difference between ECLIPSE100_2009.2 and
ECLIPSE100_2009.2_NOTARGET, this will serve you well when debugging
problems with failed jobs).

The jobs in ERT/jobs are installed into ERT with the INSTALL_JOB
commands in the sitewide configuration file.
