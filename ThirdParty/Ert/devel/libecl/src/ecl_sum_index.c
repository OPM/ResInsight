   This file contains all the internalized information from parsing a

   ecl_sum_index_type instance, and the end-user will not have direct
   interaction with the ecl_sum_index_type - but for instance when
   working with an ensemble of identical summary results one can use a
   shared ecl_sum_index instance.
