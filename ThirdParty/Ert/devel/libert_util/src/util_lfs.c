  This file, together with ifdef and typedef in util.h together try to
  define transparent large file (> 2GB) support on windows and
  linux. To support large files the datatype used to hold a file
  offset must be 64 bit, in practical consequences this means:

    - functions ftell() and fseek() must use 64 bit offset types.
    - The size field in struct stat must be 64 bit.

  On linux (at least on 64 bit platform) this is the deafult,
  i.e. large files can be accessed out of the box. On windows the
  situaton is more complicated:

     - functions ftell() and fseek() expect 32 bit offset types.
     - The size field in struct stat is a 32 bit variable.

  Observe that the situation where 32 bit offset variables are used on
  windows apply even on a 64 bit platform. To provide large file
  support windows has the functions _ftelli64() and _fseeki64() and
  the struct _stat64. Here we provide small wrapper functions
  util_ftell(), util_fseek() and typedef struct stat_info. 

  The final challenge is that the types 'long' and 'off_t == long'
  have different size on windows and linux:


     Windows(64 bit): sizeof(long)  = 4
                      sizeof(off_t) = 4  

     Linux(64 bit):   sizeof(long)  = 8
                      sizeof(off_t) = 8  


  To protect against this confusion we have typedefed a type
  'offset_type' in util.h, and all file operations should use that type.
