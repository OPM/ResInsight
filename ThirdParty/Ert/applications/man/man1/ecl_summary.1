.SH NAME
ecl_summary \- Program to extract summary vectors from ECLIPSE files
.SH DESCRIPTION
The ecl_summary program is used to quickly extract summary vectors
from ECLIPSE summary files. The program is invoked as:
.PP
computer> ecl_summary \fI\,/Path/to/ECLIPSE\/\fP key1 key2 key3 ....
.PP
Here ECLIPSE is the name of an existing case, you can give it with
extension, or without; the case need not be in the current directory.
.PP
The keys are formed by combining ECLIPSE variable names and
qualifiers from the WGNAMES and NUMS arrays. Examples of keys are:
.TP
WWCT:F\-36
\- The watercut in the well F\-36.
.TP
FOPT
\- The total field oil production.
.TP
RPR:3
\- The region pressure in region 3.
.TP
GGIT:NORTH
\- The total gas injection group NORTH.
.TP
SPR:F\-12:18
\- The segment pressure in well F\-12, segment 18.
.TP
BPR:10,10,10
\- The block pressure in cell 10,10,10.
.IP
LBPR:LGR3:10,10,10 \- The block pressure in cell 10,10,10 \- in LGR3
.PP
The option \fB\-\-list\fR can be used to list all available keys.
.SH OPTIONS
.HP
\fB\-\-list\fR : The program will list available keys.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-restart\fR: If the simulation in question is a restart, i.e a prediction
.IP
which starts at the end of the historical period, the ecl_summary
program will by default also load historical data. If the \fB\-\-no\-restart\fR
option is used the program will not look for old results.
.HP
\fB\-\-no\-header\fR: By default ecl_summary will print a header line at the top, with the
.IP
option \fB\-\-no\-header\fR this will be suppressed.
.HP
\fB\-\-report\-only\fR: Will only report results at report times (i.e. DATES).
.HP
\fB\-\-help\fR: Print this message and exit.
.PP
The options should come before the ECLIPSE basename.
.PP
Example1:
.TP
computer> ecl_summary
CASE1_XXX WWCT:F\-36   FOPT   FWPT
.IP
This example will load results from case 'CASE1_XXX' and print the
results for keys 'WWCT:F\-36', 'FOPT' and 'FWPT' on standard out.
.PP
Example2:
.TP
computer> ecl_summary
\fB\-\-list\fR CASE2_XXX "*:F\-36"  "BPR:*"
.IP
This example will list all the available keys which end with
\&':F\-36' and those which start with 'BPR:'. Observe the use of
quoting characters "" when using shell wildcards.
.PP
The ecl_summary program will look for and load both unified and
non\-unified and formatted and non\-formatted files. The default
search order is: UNSMRY, Snnnn, FUNSMRY, Annnn, however you can
manipulate this with the extension to the basename:
.PP
* If the extension corresponds to an unformatted file, ecl_summary
.IP
will only look for unformatted files.
.PP
* If the extension corresponds to a unified file, ecl_summary will
.IP
only look for unified files.
