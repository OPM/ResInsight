1 Summary

The ert Python classes are based on wrapping (some) of the C libraries
which constitute the ERT application. The wrapping is based on the
python ctypes module which does the wrapping dynamically. The python
classes are quite thin, most of the actual code is in C, however a
user of the ert Python should NOT need to know that there is some C
code deep down.


2 About ctypes

ctypes is a standard Python module for dynamic wrapping of C code. The
C code should compiled into a shared library. The ctypes library works
by loading the shared library with dlopen(). In addition there is a
quite good system for transparently mapping between Python types and C
types. More extensive documentation of ctypes is available at:
http://www.python.org/org/library/ctypes.html

2.1 Loading the shared library 

In the ert Python wrapping loading the shared library is handled by
the ert.util.clib function load(). When the shared library has been
loaded, all the symbols of the shared library are available as
attributes of the ctypes load handle. At the lowest level the loading
of shared libraries is through the ctypes.CDLL() call like:

    lib_handle = ctypes.CDLL( "libname" )

however in the ert py library this is wrapped by the function load()
in the ert.util.clib module:
 
    import ert.util.clib as clib   
    lib_handle = clib.load("name1" , "name2" , "name3")

The clib.load() function will only load one library, but it can take
several names to that library and will try loading until one of them
succeeds. This is quite useful because several of the standard
libraries are identified with different names on the different RedHat
releases, for instance zlib is loaded like this:

    zlib_handle = clib.load("libz", "libz.so.1")

When the library has been loaded, all functions of the shared library
will be available as python function attributes of the library
handle. I.e. if loading the standard library like:

    clib_handle = clib.load( "libc" )
    
The attribute clib_handle.getenv will be a pointer to a Python
function object which wraps the standard library getenv()
function. Before this is really usable we have to "tell" the function
object which input arguments and return to expect, this is done with
the restype attribute and the argtypes attribute of the function
object, more details of the prototype process can be found in section
4.2


2.2 Type mappings 

The ctypes library automagically handles conversion between common
C-types and Python types, so for the example above we would be able to
write:

    PATH = clib_handle.getenv( "PATH" )

And the conversion between Python strings and NULL based char* in C is
handled transparently. In the ert wrapping setting the type of return
values and input values is handled by the function prototype() in
ert.cwrap.cwrap.

The type mappings necessary to get prototype() function to work is
maintained in the CWrapper class in ert.cwrap.cwrap.py. During
initialization of the ert Python code there are many calls
associating the name of a C type you whish to use in the prototype
process (as a string) and the corresponding Python type:
   
   CWrapper.registerType( "int"    , ctypes.c_int )
   CWrapper.registerType( "double" , ctypes.c_double ) 
   CWrapper.registerType( "char*"  , ctypes.c_char_p )                          
   CWrapper.registerType( "int*"   , ctypes.POINTER( ctypes.c_int ))
   



2.2.1 Fundamental types

All the fundamental C types are known to the ctypes library, and
transparently converted <-> the correct Python type. 

  C type                    ctypes             Python type 
  --------------------------------------------------------
  int                       c_int              int
  float                     c_float            float
  double                    c_double           double      
  .....
  char * (NULL terminated)  c_char_p           string
  --------------------------------------------------------   

All these types can be created by calling them with an optional
initializer of the correct type and value:

  cint = ctypes.c_int( 42 )

With the function ctypes.POINTER() you can create pointers to the
fundamental types - but this is approaching dangerous territory!


2.2.2 User defined types and classes

Let us say you have a C function which expects a pointer to an
abstract data type as input:

   void abstract_method( abstract_type * at );

And that you have implemented the Python class AT which wraps a
pointer to a at instance in a "c_ptr" attribute. If the AT class
contains a method:

  def from_param( self ):
      return ctypes.c_void_p( self.c_ptr )

The AT class can then be used as a Python type in the argtypes
attributes. To make it available in the prototyping as well you must
register the type:

   CWrapper.registerType( "at" , AT )

Observe that the AT class should NOT be used as restype, i.e. for the
return value:

    /-- Warning: ----------------------------------------------\
    | The mapping of types generally works quite well, however |
    | observe that the return type of C functions which return |
    | an instance pointer is NOT the current class, but        |
    | c_void_p, that is because this return value is           | 
    | internalized in the c_ptr attribute of the object.       |
    \----------------------------------------------------------/


3 The C code

The C libraries are to a large extent developed with abstract types
like:

  typedef struct {
     .....
     .....
  } abs_type;

and "methods" like:

  abs_type * abs_type_alloc( ) { }
  void       abs_type_free( abs_type * at ) {}
  int        abs_type_get_an_int( const abs_type * at) {}
  void       abs_type_set_an_int( abs_type * at , int value) {}

it has therefore been relatively easy to map this onto Python classes
and give a pythonic feel to the whole thing. As a ground rule each C
file implements one struct; this struct is wrapped in a Python module
with the same name and a Python class with CamelCaps naming:

    C                                  Python
    ecl_kw.c implements ecl_kw_type    ecl_kw.py implements EclKW




4 Common structure of the wrapping

The wrapping of the libraries (currently only libecl is anything close
to complete) follow roughly the same structure:

  1. Load the shared library

  2. For each C "class" you wish to wrap {

       2.1. Prototype the C functions you wish to use by creating Python
            function objects with correct restype and argtypes
            attributes for the functions you are interested in, using
            the CWrapper.prototype() function.

       2.2. Create the Python class - based on the prototype functions
            from 2.1 above.

     }     
     
The following excerpt from ecl_kw.y illustrates this:

    ------------------------------------------------------------
    # Load the shared library
    import libecl                                    <---  Step 1

    Class EclKW:                                     <-------------·
          # Pure Python code to implement the EclKW class,         |
          # based on the functions prototyped below.               |   Step 3
          ....                                       <-------------· 
    
    # Create a wrapper instance which wraps the libecl library. <--------·
    cwrapper = CWrapper( libecl.lib )                                    |
                                                                         | 
    # Register the type mapping "ecl_kw" <-> EclKW                       | Step 2
    cwrapper.registerType( "ecl_kw" , EclKW )                            |
                                                                         |
    # Prototype the functions needed to implement the Python class       |
    cfunc.alloc_new = cwrapper.prototype("long ecl_kw_alloc( char* , int , int )")
    cfunc.free      = cwrapper.prototype("void ecl_kw_free( ecl_kw )")   |                 
    ....                                                        <--------· 
    ------------------------------------------------------------

These three steps are described in more detail in 4.1 - 4.3 below.


4.1 Loading the shared library

For loading the shared library 'libecl.so' there is a module
'libecl.py' which calls the actual loading function, load() in
ert.cwrap.clib.py. Subsequently the library instance will be a 'lib'
attribute of the the libecl module, so that subsequent functions which
need access to the function objects pointing to C functions, like
e.g. the prototype function in the CWrapper class, will use this
attribute.

If you take a detailed look at some of the "import libxxx" statements
they might seem superfluous, in the sense that the active scope does
not reference the imported library, however in many cases the "import
libxxxx" statements are for side-effects only.


4.2 Prototyping

As mentioned in section 2.1 we must "tell" the function pointers the
type of the return value and the input arguments. This is done by
setting the restype and argtypes attributes. For the getenv() function
which takes one (char *) input and returns a (char *) pointer this
would be:

    clib_handle.getenv.restype  =   ctypes.c_char_p
    clib_handle.getenv.argtypes = [ ctypes.c_char_p ] 
    
In the ert python code this is achieved with the helper class CWrapper
implemented in the module ert.cwrap.cwrap:

    from ert.cwrap.cwrap import CWrapper

    lib = clib.load( "libc" ) 
    wrapper = CWRapper( lib )
    getenv = wrapper.prototype("char*  getenv( char* )")

The prototype() method of the CWrapper class is essentially one
massive regular expression which parses the "char* getenv( char* )"
string and assigns the correct restype and argtypes attributes.


All the calls to the prototype() method are typically assembled in the
bottom of the file implementing a class defintion. E.g. the bottom of
the ecl_kw.py file looks like this:

  # 1: Load the shared library  
  cwrapper = CWrapper( libecl.lib )

  # 2: Register type mapping ecl_kw <--> EclKW
  cwrapper.registerType( "ecl_kw" , EclKW )

  # 3: Prototype the C functions we will use from Python
  cfunc = CWrapperNameSpace("ecl_kw")
  cfunc.get_size       = cwrapper.prototype("int ecl_kw_get_size( ecl_kw )")
  cfunc.get_type       = cwrapper.prototype("int ecl_kw_get_type( ecl_kw )")
  cfunc.iget_char_ptr  = cwrapper.prototype("char* ecl_kw_iget_char_ptr( ecl_kw , int )")
  cfunc.iset_char_ptr  = cwrapper.prototype("void ecl_kw_iset_char_ptr( ecl_kw , int , char*)")
  cfunc.iget_bool      = cwrapper.prototype("bool ecl_kw_iget_bool( ecl_kw , int)")
  cfunc.iset_bool      = cwrapper.prototype("bool ecl_kw_iset_bool( ecl_kw , int, bool)")
  cfunc.alloc_new      = cwrapper.prototype("c_void_p ecl_kw_alloc( char* , int , int )")
  ....
  ....

This makes the function cfunc.get_size, cfunc.get_type,
cfunc.iget_char_ptr, ... available as first class Python functions,
and the Python classes can be implemented based on these
functions. Observe that the return value from "ecl_kw_alloc()" is
c_void_p' and not ecl_kw - that is because this return value is
internalized in the c_ptr of the object (this is not particularly
elegant, and could probably be improved upon..??).

The prototyped functions is quite low-level, and they should __NOT__
be used outside the file scope where they are defined.


4.3 Python classes

All the main Python classes wrap a C based structure, and contain
roughly the same structure:

  * The underlying C structure is 'held' with the attribute c_ptr,
    c_ptr is just a c_void_p instance which holds the pointer value of
    the underlying C structure. The name c_ptr is just convention, and
    could be anything. The type of c_ptr is 'c_void_p'.

    Mapping between a class instance and the C pointer held by this
    instance is handled with the 'from_param' function:

       def from_param( self ):
           return self.c_ptr

    The name 'from_param' is goverened by ctypes; the from_param
    method is called automatically by the ctypes runtime.

  * The __init__() function, or alternatively a classmethod
    constructor calls the C based constructor, like
    e.g. ecl_grid_alloc() and internalize the return value in the
    attribute 'c_ptr'; alternatively the c_ptr might come as a shared
    reference from another function.

  * The __del__ function is called when the Python object is garbage
    collected, then the corresponding C free function should be
    called, e.g. ecl_grid_free().
  




5 Garbage collection and 'data_owner'

The Python language has garbage collection, and as a user of the ert
python code you should just assume that the garbage collection works
for the ert py types. However, if you want to wrap new types (or maybe
fix a bug ...) you should understand how the the ert py classes
interact with garbage collection.

When the Python interpreter decides that an object will be collected,
the __del__() method of that object is called, and any non-standard
cleanup code can be called here. In the case of ert py, this is where
the C based destructor can be called. The important point is that it
differs from case to case whether the C based constructor should
indeed be called.

The EclKW class illustrates this quite well. Broadly speaking you can
instantiate an EclKW instance in two ways:

  * Through the EclwKW.new() function 
  * As a reference to an existing ecl_kw through an EclFile instance.

In the first case the c_ptr of the EclKW instance will point to fresh
storage dedicated to this EclKW, and when the EclKW instance goes out
of scope the memory should be freed with a call to the C function
ecl_kw_free(). 

   EclKW (Python)       ecl_kw (C) 
      c_ptr               
       |                ---------
       \--------------->| PORO  |
                        | REAL  |
                        | 10000 |
                        |-------|
                        | 0.15  |
                        | 0.19  |
                        | ...   |   
                        ---------


In the second case an EclFile instance has been created, and this
object points to ecl_file C struct which is essentially a container
containing many ecl_kw instances. We can then query the EclFile
instance to get reference to the various ecl_kw keywords, i.e. for a
small restart file:

                        
EclFile (Python)      ecl_file (C)             EclKW (Python)  
   c_ptr                                          c_ptr
    |                 ------------                  |
    \---------------->| PRESSURE |                  |   
                      | SGAS <---+------------------/
                      | SWAT     |
                      | ....     |
                      ------------

The situaton above (which is quite typical) could for instance come
about from:

   restart_file = ecl.EclFile( "ECLIPSE.X0057" )
   sgas_kw      = restart_file.iget_named_kw( "SGAS" , 0 )

Now, when the sgas_kw object goes out of scope it is important that
the SGAS ecl_kw in the ecl_file file container is _NOT_ deleted, that
keyword is owned by the ecl_file container and the whole thing will
crash and burn if the ecl_kw is destroyed bypassing the container. The
sgas keyword will be destroyed when the restart_file object goes out
scope at a later stage.

To facilitate this difference in behaviour when an EclKW goes out
scope the object contains a field 'data_owner', and the __del__()
method looks like this:

  def __del__( self ):
     if self.data_owner:
         cfunc.free( self )

I.e. the C based free() function is only called if the object is the
owner of the underlying C structure.  This technique is implemented in
many of the objects. In the current code the data_owner field is set
alongside with the c_ptr field, and not modified during the lifetime
of the object (i.e. the implementation does not support 'hostile
takeover' or 'orphaning' of objects).



6 Installation in Statoil

In Statoil the ert Python libraries are installed in the /project/res
hierarchy.
