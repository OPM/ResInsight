The EnKF functionality is organized in xxx libraries with different
functionalities. The different libraries depend on eachother, and the
libraries must be built in correct order. The dependencies is as
follows:

libhash  :
libutil  : libhash
libecl   : libhash libutil
librms   : libecl  libutil libhash
libsched : libecl  linutil libhash
libenkf  : libecl  libsched librm linutil libhash


libhash:  This library implements the classes hash_type, set_type and
          list_type.

libutil:  This library is a collection utility routines. Observe that
          this library only implements routines, and not statefull
          objects.

libecl:   This library implements functions for reading/writing ECLIPSE
          restart/summary/init/grid files.

libsched: This library implements a basic SCHEDULE file parser.

librms:   This library implements (basic) reader and writer for binary
          RMS ROFF files.

libenkf:  This library implements various high level objects for EnKF
          functionality.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

All the makefiles start with the statement:

include "path_config"

The file path_config is *not* under version control, this is on
purpose because every user can/should have a private confiiguration of
paths. The file path_config should define make-variables for the
location of all the libraries, this is an example of a valid
path-config file:

   LIBHASH_HOME  = /h/a152128/EnKF/EnKF/libhash
   LIBUTIL_HOME  = /h/a152128/EnKF/EnKF/libutil
   LIBSCHED_HOME = /h/a152128/EnKF/EnKF/libsched
   LIBRMS_HOME   = /h/a152128/EnKF/EnKF/librms
   LIBECL_HOME   = /h/a152128/EnKF/EnKF/libecl
   LIBENKF_HOME  = /h/a152128/EnKF/EnKF/libenkf

In this example all libraries have a common path prefix, that is not
a requirement.
