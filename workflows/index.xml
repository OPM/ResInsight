      <description>Background&#xA;The Biot porelastic coefficient defines the compressibility of sand grains, and will influence some of the calculations in ResInsight.&#xA;Description The Biot coefficient can be defined in three ways:&#xA;Default (Constant value of 1.0) User defined constant for all element One value for each element based on imported values from an element property table These settings are controlled from the Property Editor when a Geomechanical Case is selected. To use Biot coefficients for each element, perform the following steps:</description>

      <description>Introduction To study the structural uncertainty, ResInsight enables the user to create and import an ensemble of surfaces and compute the statistical surfaces based on this ensemble. This page describes the interactive workflow, but in many cases it can be useful to create scripts related to mangement of Ensemble Surfaces. See Python Examples for more details.&#xA;Create Ensemble Surface From the right-click menu of surfaces, select Import Ensemble Surface</description>

      <description>Automatically identify new well target candidates by identifying connected cluster of cells based on user defined threshold values.&#xA;Configuration Import a grid model, and from the right-click menu of a grid model select “New Well Target Mapping”. A Well Target Mapping object is displayed with the following options:</description>
