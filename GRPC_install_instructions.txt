########## Windows using vcpkg ###################
1. Clone VCPKG
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git

4. Install VCPKG from within vcpkg folder:
.\boostrap-vcpkg.bat
5. Perform integrated install (as admin) within vcpkg folder. Not sure if it is necessary.
.\vcpkg integrate install
5. Install GRPC
.\vcpkg install grpc --triplet x64-windows
6. Run cmake with -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=LOCATION_OF_VCPKG/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
   This can be set on the configure dialog that comes up when you press configure with a fresh build folder.
7. Enable GRPC by setting RESINSIGHT_ENABLE_GRPC = true
8. Make sure the python executable is found by setting PYTHON_EXECUTABLE=LOCATION_OF_PYTHON.EXE

############ Linux as STANDALONE GPRC (using GRPC_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/grpc as an example) ###############
1. Clone grpc
https://github.com/grpc/grpc.git
2. From within grpc folder, check out stable version of grpc and initialise repo:
git checkout v1.20.1
git submodule init
git submodule update
3. Make sure you're building with devtools-3, since you'll be using that for ResInsight too
scl enable devtoolset-3 bash
make prefix=/opt/grpc
sudo make prefix=/opt/grpc install
3. Install protobuf (still within grpc folder)
cd third_party/protobuf
sudo make prefix=/opt/grpc install
4. Install grpcio-tools for Python (this may have to be done as root user):
pip install grpcio-tools
5. Run cmake making sure GRPC_INSTALL_PREFIX is set to /opt/grpc, PYTHON_EXECUTABLE set to a good python 3 and RESINSIGHT_ENABLE_GRPC = true
