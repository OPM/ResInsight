      <description>Summary Plots are a display of curves based on Eclipse Summary Data which can be combined with imported observed data, grid cell time history curve, and pasted ascii curves.
Summary plots are displayed on screen by maximum four rows by four columns of plots. In the example above, ResInsight displays two columns and two rows of plots, each plot comprising a single curve. However, a plot may contain an arbitrary number of curves.</description>

      <description>Data Sources provides an overview of all data sources for summary plots by category to provide search, selection, and essential functionality pertinent to summary cases.
As seen above, Data Sources enables search and sourcing of data from case, field, regions, wells, groups, or ensemble. See Summary Plots which illustrates use of Data Sources for effective search and selection of data for summary plots.
Searching for data sources Atop the Data Sources window, there is a search field for effective searches across all available data sources.</description>

      <description>Summary Plot Source Stepping enables the user to efficiently step through multiple vectors, wells, summary cases, ensembles, groups, regions, blocks, and aquifers for plotting purposes. Source stepping is available from both the Source Stepping Toolbar and the Property editor as described below.
Source Stepping using the toolbar The toolbar for source stepping is:
Following this example, the available options are:
Explicitly setting Step By to vector WBHP by Change existing plot to display previous or next vector by pressing one of the buttons Step previous or next vector and add a plot by the buttons Step previous or next vector and add a curve by the buttons Source Stepping using the Property Editor Source Stepping is also available through the Property Editor.</description>

      <description>The plot editor is a separate ResInsight dialog window where the user can select which vectors to display in a summary plot. It is also possible to edit an existing plot in this editor.
The upper part of the editor contains editors for selecting which vectors/summaries to display in the plot. The number of fields vary from 3 to 6 depending on the Summary Type currently highlighted.
Here highlighted means marked item with different background color, while selected means item(s) having a ticked check box.</description>

      <description>A Summary Cross Plot is a window displaying a graph in the main area of the Plot Main Window. It is very similar to an ordinary Summary Plot, but the x-axis displays summary vector values instead of time. Regression analysis is supported on single cross plot curves and ensemble statistics curves.
Summary Cross Plot Curves New cross plot curves are created by using the right-click command New Summary Cross Plot Curve on a summary plot.</description>

      <description>An ensemble is a group of cases that are tightly coupled, only a set of ensemble input parameters differ between cases. This makes it relevant to perform calculations and statistics analysis on ensembles.
Import There are several ways to import an ensemble:
Use menu option File-&amp;gt;Import-&amp;gt;Summary Cases-&amp;gt;Import Ensemble Use menu option File-&amp;gt;Import-&amp;gt;Summary Cases-&amp;gt;Import Summary Case group and then convert the group to an ensemble Import a number of summary cases, move them into a group and then convert the group to an ensemble During import of a summary case, ResInsight tries to find an associated parameters.</description>

      <guid>https://resinsight.org/plot-window/objectivefunctions/</guid>
      <description>An Objective Function is used to color the curves of an ensemble plot in ResInsight to highlight characteristics by a function definition based on individual summary vectors. As shown in the example above, the legend relates colours to values as calculated by a particular objective function and shows the use and formula of the objective function in the plot.
Using Objective Functions Curve coloring by Objective Function is activated as shown below.</description>

      <description>An RFT (Repeated Formation Tester) plot is a special well plot for comparing observed formation pressure and simulated formation pressure. The curves are plotted as pressure against true vertical depth (TVD) or measured depth (MD). Simulated pressure data is retrieved directly from the grid model or from the corresponding (*.rft) files, while observed pressure data are loaded from well log files (*.las).

      <description>RFT Segment Data can be plotted as horizontal Well Log Plots. RFT data can be imported based on a summary case or a grid case.
Create RFT Segment Plot Open a summary case with RFT data
Additional data from WSEGLINK Some cases require data from WSEGLINK keyword. When importing summary data, ResInsight will automatically search for the related *.DATA file. The identified file can be seen or changed from the Property Editor.</description>

      <description>ResInsight allows the user to create a ensemble RFT plot similar to summary ensemble plots. The functionality also computes statistics, e.g. P10, P90, and mean. When possible, ResInsight avoids loading the grid when reading ensemble RFT data.
Create New Ensemble RFT Plot When a summary ensemble has been imported, observed FMU data can be imported via right-clicking Observed Data in the Plot Project Tree, and selecting Import Observed FMU Data.</description>

      <description>A PLT (Production Log Tool) plot is a special well plot for comparing observed production (well flow rates) and simulated production. The curves are plotted as production against measured depth (MD). Simulated production data is retrieved directly from the grid model or from the corresponding (*.rft) files, while observed production data are loaded from well log files (*.las).

      <description>A Vertical Flow Performance Plot (VFP Plot) shows the relationship between bottom hole well conditions and wellhead pressure describing a well&amp;rsquo;s ability to lift fluids to the surface. ResInsight can display both production and injection VFP plots:
Production VFP Plots show the outflow or downstream pressure based on the inlet or upstream pressure and the phases flowing. For a well, this means the table relates the flowing bottom-hole pressure (BHP) to the well&amp;rsquo;s tubing head pressure (THP) based on the oil, gas and water rates (and any artificial lift quantities like gas lift gas), or phases ratios, flowing up the wellbore.</description>

      <description>ResInsight supports the creation of scatter / cross plots of two Eclipse results against each other, with each cell in the grid representing one data point in the plot. The data points can be grouped by a third result, by time step or by Formations. giving a separate color and label for each group. The above example shows a classic Porosity vs Permeability plot, grouped by formations, showing different trends for each formation.</description>

      <description>A Saturation Pressure Plot a plot displaying bubble and dew point pressures, together with initial pressure in model, versus depth. Fluid contacts (GOC and/or OWC) are displayed as annotation lines in the generated plots. One Saturation Pressure Plot is created for each equilibrium region.
To be able to create these plots, output of saturation pressures need to be specified in the SOLUTION section of the Eclipse &amp;ldquo;.DATA&amp;rdquo; file.
To create these plots, right click on the view in the Property Editor, and select Create Saturation Pressure Plots.</description>
