      <description>Summary Plots are a display of curves based on Eclipse Summary Data which can be combined with imported observed data, grid cell time history curve, and pasted ascii curves.&#xA;Summary plots are displayed on screen by maximum four rows by four columns of plots. In the example above, ResInsight displays two columns and two rows of plots, each plot comprising a single curve. However, a plot may contain an arbitrary number of curves. As shown in the screenshot above, essential helpers for setup of Summary Plots are:</description>

      <description>An ensemble is a group of cases that are tightly coupled, only a set of ensemble input parameters differ between cases. This makes it relevant to perform calculations and statistics analysis on ensembles.&#xA;Import There are several ways to import an ensemble:&#xA;Use menu option File-&gt;Import-&gt;Summary Cases-&gt;Import Ensemble Use menu option File-&gt;Import-&gt;Summary Cases-&gt;Import Summary Case group and then convert the group to an ensemble Import a number of summary cases, move them into a group and then convert the group to an ensemble During import of a summary case, ResInsight tries to find an associated parameters.txt file or runspecification.xml file containing ensemble parameters. If found, the ensemble parameters are stored together with the summary case. When the user adds a summary case to an ensemble, then ResInsight will perform ensemble parameters validation. A warning dialog is displayed in the following cases:</description>

      <description>A Vertical Flow Performance Plot (VFP Plot) shows the relationship between bottom hole well conditions and wellhead pressure describing a well’s ability to lift fluids to the surface. ResInsight can display both production and injection VFP plots:&#xA;Production VFP Plots show the outflow or downstream pressure based on the inlet or upstream pressure and the phases flowing. For a well, this means the table relates the flowing bottom-hole pressure (BHP) to the well’s tubing head pressure (THP) based on the oil, gas and water rates (and any artificial lift quantities like gas lift gas), or phases ratios, flowing up the wellbore. The data is read from files containing the VFPPROD Eclipse keyword.</description>
