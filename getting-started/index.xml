      <description>User Interface ResInsight has two main windows, one for 3D related visualizations and one for 2D graphs and plots.
3D Main Window Plot Main Window Switching Between the Two Main Windows The two main windows has a toolbar button each, that directly opens and raises the other window. Each of the windows can also be closed freely, but if both are closed, ResInsight exits.
Docking Windows Each of the main windows has a central area and several docking windows surrounding it.</description>
