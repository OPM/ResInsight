      <description>Configuration of cloud services is described in Cloud Services - Authorization.
Summary Ensembles from SUMO Summary ensemble data can be accessed from SUMO. ResInsight will store the required information to the data source, and fetch data from the cloud during project import.
Select Cloud Data, this will show available fields with cases in the Data Source Property Editor Select Field and Case, and a list of available ensembles are displayed Select Ensembles and push Add Ensembles.</description>

      <description>Authorization Currently supported cloud services use OAuth 2.0, the industry-standerd protocol for authentication. The first time a user initiates data from a cloud service, a browser window will appear for the user to enter username/password followed by additional two-factor authentication. A text string usually called a token is created, containing the access and authorization information required to access the cloud data source. This token is cached by ResInsight in the .</description>

      <description>ResInsight supports the following type of Eclipse input data:
*.GRID and *.EGRID files along with their *.INIT and restart files *.XNNN and *.UNRST. Grid and Property data from *.GRDECL files. Release 2018.11 supports import of simulations from Intersect. To be able to import into ResInsight, the Intersect simulation must be exported into Eclipse file format.
Eclipse Results ResInsight offers several ways to import Eclipse (grid) files. Use one of the following commands in the File-&amp;gt;Import-&amp;gt;Eclipse Cases menu:</description>

      <description>Summary data can be imported as a single summary file or an ensemble of summary files.
Basic Summary Import Summary data is located in two files, summary vector names in *.SMSPEC and curve data in *.UNSMRY.
For import of ensemble datasets, see Ensemble File Dialog.
Origin Files During summary file import, ResInsight checks whether the summary file is restarted, i.e. has an origin file. If an origin file is found, the Origin Files dialog is displayed.</description>

      <description>Ensemble File Import When using the standard file selection dialog, the user is limited to select files in one directory only. If the interesting files are distributed over multiple directories, the dialog has to be opened once for each directory. The recursive file selection dialog is created to circumvent this limitation. This dialog is able to search a directory tree for files matching a specified pattern.
This dialog is used for import of different file types like *.</description>

Roff Data Roff Data can be imported from File-&amp;gt;Import-&amp;gt;Roff Grid Models-&amp;gt;Import Roff Case menu. Select a grid file and additional files with properties in the import dialog. The grid will be displayed and used in the same way as an Eclipse grid model.</description>

      <description>Log ASCII Standard (LAS) is a standard file format common in the oil-and-gas industry to store well log information.
Importing a LAS file Log ASCII Standard (LAS) files can be imported using the command: File-&amp;gt;Import-&amp;gt; Well Data-&amp;gt;Import Well Logs from File.
ResInsight will look for the the well name in the imported LAS-files among the existing Well Paths. If a match is found, the LAS-file is placed as a child of that well path.</description>

      <description>ResInsight can be built with support for reading and displaying geomechanical analysis models produced by ABAQUS in the *.odb format. This is only possible if you or your organization has a copy of the ODB-Api from Simulia, and a valid license to use it.
If you have, and would like to a use these features, please see Build Instructions for a description on how to build ResInsight and how to include the support for odb-files.</description>

      <description>ResInsight is able to import transient results from the simulation software SourSimRL to combine reservoir souring simulation data with an Eclipse case for analysis and visualization. Results from SourSimRL in its sourres binary format can be imported using the SourSim File Name field as shown below:
Importing such a file will enable result type called SourSimRL as explained in Eclipse Result Types</description>

      <description>Element property tables in ABQUS input file format can be imported into ResInsight and displayed as Element Results. This can be used to display material properties, or any scalar value on each element.
To view the data as a Color Result select the Result Position: Element ( See Geomechanical Results )
A couple of property names are recognized and treated specially:
MODULUS &amp;ndash; Scaled by 1.0e-9 and shown as &amp;ldquo;Young&amp;rsquo;s Modulus&amp;rdquo; in the user interface RATIO &amp;ndash; Shown as &amp;ldquo;Poisson&amp;rsquo;s Ratio&amp;rdquo; in the user interface File Format A couple of examples on the file format are shown below.</description>

      <description>Observed Time History Data, is data measured in time. On import of observed time history data, ResInsight translates the data to make it similar to summary data. Observed time history data can be plotted along with summary data in Summary Plots.
Import Observed Time History Data Importing observed time history data to ResInsight may be performed in two different ways:
By selecting the main menu item File -&amp;gt; Import -&amp;gt; Import Observed Data By using the right-click command Import Observed Data on the Observed Data item in the Plot Main Window Project Tree The following file types are supported:</description>

      <description>A grid model can be imported from several sources, either Eclipse binary/ascii or ROFF binary/ascii. Grid properties in separate files can be imported into any grid type as long as the number of grid cells is matching.
Appending properties
From the right-click menu of the case or Cell Result, select Add Input Property Select the file with properties The imported data is then available in the Cell Result by activating the Input Property in the Type drop down list.</description>
