      <description>This section describes how wells defined in the simulation are displayed, and how to control the different aspects of their visualization.
Commands Several commands are available as right-click commands on a simulation well. These commands are available either by right-clicking the well in the 3D View or in the Project Tree.
 New Well Log Extraction Curve &amp;ndash; Creates a new Well Log curve based on the selected simulation well, the current time step and cell property.</description>

      <description>ResInsight can import well paths from simple Ascii files. In addition, ResInsight is able to retrieve well paths from an Equinor internal web service.
ResInsight also supports creation of your own user-defined well paths. See Create Well Paths
Ascii Well Paths The command File -&amp;gt; Import -&amp;gt; Well Data -&amp;gt; Import Well Paths From File will read the well paths in the selected file, and create one entry for each well path under the Wells item in the Project Tree.</description>

      <description>ResInsight lets the user create new/custom well paths by clicking in the 3D view. A self created well path will behave the same way as an ordinary imported well path.
Building a multilateral well path
Building a well path  Right click Wells in the project tree Select Create Well Path in the right-click menu. A new well node and a well targets node are created Click in the 3D view on locations where the well path should pass (well path targets) When finished placing targets, click on &amp;ldquo;Stop Picking Targets&amp;rdquo; in the property editor  Well targets property editor fields:</description>

      <description>ResInsight lets the user create additional well path laterals by clicking in the 3D view. Completions can be added to laterals, and the complete specification of the well can be exported using the Completion Export
Building a well path  Start from an existing well path, either imported or create a new well path In the 3D view, right-click on the well path at the depth location for your lateral  A new well path lateral is created, and click in the 3D scene to define targets for the lateral Repeat from 2.</description>

      <title>3D Well Log Plots</title>

      <description>ResInsight can display well logs curves directly in the 3D view with a subset of the functionality of the full 2D Well Log Plot Editor. The curves will be drawn in a plane next to or centered on the well trajectory they belong to and can display well log data from a simulation model and from imported LAS-files.
Creating new 3D Well Log Curves Add a new 3D well log curve by selecting a Well Path in the Project Tree, right-clicking and selecting 3D Well Log Curves and Add 3D Well Log Curve.</description>

      <description>Three types of completions are available for modeling and export: Perforation intervals, fishbone wells and fractures. The purpose of modeling these completions, is that it enables ResInsight to export Eclipse keywords for doing more refined simulations.
Completions can be modeled by adding new perforation intervals, fishbones subs or fractures. Details about the completions must then be specified, such as the length of the perforation interval or number of fishbone subs and laterals.</description>

      <description>Importing Ensemble Fracture Statistics Right-click on Completion Templates &amp;gt; Ensemble Fracture Statistics in the Project Tree and select the Import StimPlan Fracture Recursively option. Then select the StimPlan fracture Xml files to be part of the ensemble.
After importing the Property Panel of the Ensemble Fracture Statistics item has these options:
 Name &amp;ndash; Name of the ensemble fracture statistics. Exclude Zero Width Fractures &amp;ndash; Toggle to remove zero width fractures from the statistics.</description>

      <title>Completions LGR</title>
      <link>https://resinsight.org/wells-and-completions/completionslgr/</link>

      <guid>https://resinsight.org/wells-and-completions/completionslgr/</guid>
      <description>ResInsight supports creating and exporting LGRs (Local Grid Refinement) in main grid cells intersected by completions.
Create Temporary LGRs To create temporary LGR(s), first select one or more well paths in the project tree, right click and select &amp;lsquo;Create Temporary LGR&amp;rsquo;. This command brings up the following dialog.
The dialog contains several input fields
 Source Case &amp;ndash; The source case/grid Time Step &amp;ndash; The time step to use Fractures, Fishbones, Perforations &amp;ndash; Check boxes to control which completion types to create LGRs for Split Type &amp;ndash; Three options controlling how the LGRs will be created  LGR Per Cell &amp;ndash; One LGR is created for each main grid cell intersected by completions of the selected type LGR Per Completion &amp;ndash; One LGR is created for each completion of the selected types.</description>

      <title>Well Measurements</title>
      <link>https://resinsight.org/wells-and-completions/wellmeasurements/</link>

      <guid>https://resinsight.org/wells-and-completions/wellmeasurements/</guid>
      <description>ResInsight can import well measurements from a comma-separated values file.
Importing Well Measurements The command File -&amp;gt; Import -&amp;gt; Well Data -&amp;gt; Import Measurements will read well measurements from the selected files, and create one entry for each file under the Wells -&amp;gt; Well Measurements item in the Project Tree.
File Format The format is comma-separated values with one measurement per line. The following requirements have to be met:
 Each data line must contain seven values: Well Name, MD, Date, Measurement Kind, Value, Quality, and Comment.</description>
